Sentiment Analysis Review ChatGPT

As the name suggests, it means to identify the view or emotion behind a situation. It basically means to analyze and find the emotion or intent behind a piece of text or speech or any mode of communication.

We, humans, communicate with each other in a variety of languages, and any language is just a mediator or a way in which we try to express ourselves. And, whatever we speak or write, has a sentiment associated with it. It might be positive or negative or it might be neutral as well.
