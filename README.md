## Sentiment Analysis Review ChatGPT

As the name suggests, it means to identify the view or emotion behind a situation. It basically means to analyze and find the emotion or intent behind a piece of text or speech or any mode of communication.

We, humans, communicate with each other in a variety of languages, and any language is just a mediator or a way in which we try to express ourselves. And, whatever we speak or write, has a sentiment associated with it. It might be positive or negative or it might be neutral as well.

As we know, with the development of technology, there are many AI technologies that can help humans work, one of which is ChatGPT. Until now, this technology has still raised pros and cons because it is felt that it can backfire on humans themselves.
