"Up to this point I’ve mostly been using ChatGPT on my windows desktop using Google Chrome. While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.
Well, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.
I would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.
Otherwise, fantastic app so far!",positif
"I’ve been a user since it’s initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app. For reference  I’m a software engineering student while working in IT full time. I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller. Anyway, awesome app 5 stars.",positif
"This app would almost be perfect if it wasn’t for ONE little thing: a “search in” function. As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat & look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat & track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.",positif
"I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.",positif
"I appreciate the devs implementing Siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app, despite being a little clunky. I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. 

In addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. 

Otherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.",positif
"No doubt, this technology is absolutely life-changing, especially for me. You don’t know how thankful I am. However, I’m not reviewing the underlying technology, I’m reviewing its implementation on iOS. I use it for about 12 hours a day for my work, so I’m a bit picky. But it seems to me like you should have the resources to do a great job here. 1. Why does the app not work in the background? If I send a request, I have to stay in the app to wait for it. That’s just horrible, and it’s completely unnecessary because you’re doing everything in the cloud anyway. Just finish processing and send a notification when you’re done, especially for browsing features. I don’t care if it takes 10 minutes to find the answer. I’d be glad if it’s browsing in the background. (To browse in the application as of May 24, start a conversation in the browser, select the browsing option, then switch back to the app. Browsing is still in beta, and you cannot select it directly in the application, which is fine.) 2. Please add the option to choose Chat GPT4 as a default. I never use GPT 3.5, and it’s annoying to have to switch every time. 3. Don’t let the speech-to-text button disappear once there is any text. If there is any text and speech recognition is started, just append. (The speech recognition is completely amazing, congratulations!) As soon as those features are ready, I’ll be glad to give five stars. Thank you very much.",negatif
"Please provide a TABLET experience on iPad with the collapsible list of history on the left and chat on the right - similar to your desktop browser app. 2) while generating responses on the desktop browser, it pauses and keeps displaying “Continue generating responses” button for every few items/responses forcing to click the button repeatedly. During generation, there is a button to “Stop generating responses” - if we need to stop, we can always click this button - there is no need to pause and ask us to click continue again and again which is a bad UX. 3) there is no way to delete individual chat items from a chat history list of items to clean up the list. Eg: I open a chat history and it has 10 questions but I’m not able to delete 2 questions from this list on long tapping on the questions. 

4) if I ask for “top 20”, it generates just 10 answers and displays “please let me know if you’d like more “ but no option to generate more responses to the question. Either generate all 20 answers (ideally) or provide an option to continue generation.

Please provide options to delete questions from a history and also move questions/responses to another history. Please offer these features and I’ll gladly give it 5 stars. Cheers!",netral
"Chat GPT is seriously underrated, dude! I mean, this mobile app is a total game-changer for everyday life. It's like having a super smart buddy in your pocket, ready to give you answers, explanations, and insights on anything you throw at it. Got a burning question? Boom, Chat GPT's got your back, no problemo!

But wait, there's more! This app is also an awesome conversation partner. When you're itching for a chat, even if your buddies are busy, Chat GPT's got you covered. And the best part? It's always there, ready to shoot the breeze whenever and wherever, right on your mobile.

You know what else? Chat GPT adapts to your needs, man. Need help making decisions? It's got your back. Want some creative inspiration? It's got that too. This app is like a Swiss Army knife, always ready with the right tool for the job. And as you use it, you're not just getting answers, you're also growing your brain with the cool stuff you learn along the way.

So, let's give it up for Chat GPT, the unsung hero of mobile apps! It's time to appreciate how it makes our lives easier, more interesting, and way more fun. Cheers to Chat GPT, bro!

*I wrote this review with only about 3 or 4 prompts using Chat GPT 🤣 this should show you the power of this mobile app. I definitely will be getting the premium version soon. I just wish the interface was more entertaining however it’s basic interface helps you focus on the task at hand*",positif
"On this app, as opposed to on the website, it feels like answers appear quicker. That’s great, and really the reason I downloaded the app because I suspected there may be a better connection to the servers.
My complaints are that it takes two taps to get to the history, and it’s not overly obvious how to access it. I like to be able to continue past conversations easily, and it was slightly more difficult on this app than on the website. (It’s kind of a nitpick, but it’s still something I would like to see changed)
The UI is extremely simple, and the settings include everything I would want in there. My last complaint is the haptics. It’s default is on, and I wouldn’t mind that except that it’s a little excessive. I don’t want to feel like chatGPT is banging the answer on the back of my phone every time I prompt it. You can turn haptics off if you want though, without even needing to go into the settings app.

Other than those minor complaints, it seems like this is a great app, and serves its purpose in an elegant manner. I would highly recommend.",positif
"There’s been times of apps touting they are chat GPT or they use chat GPT software but this is the original and only official chat GPT 4 app created by open AI so no need to pay for any other apps. They are constantly updating and adding features, and I suggest upgrading to plus and paying that cost so you can access plug-ins. The founders of this app and the whole team have done such a Incredible job. This is the only one you mean when it comes to AI 🤝this software has given everyone a level playing field pretty much and it’s gonna catch me to change everything. The time we’re living in now akin to the gold rush or the Industrial Revolution. Take advantage before it becomes Crowded. The power dynamics are shifting. Now that others are able to access information that was previously not available or very hard to access is there for everyone to make moves and better their lives. Instead of focusing on all the jobs that will be lost think about all the jobs that will be created or that you can create using this technology.",positif
"This is the beginning of the future of how we interact with information. Any question at any time. Never runs out of patience. Never gets annoyed with you, never calls you stupid, never gets upset at you for asking stupid questions, and has an answer for everything. Need to explain something and can’t think of the right words to actually convey rhe information? Need to make sure a sentence you’ve been working on for an hour actually still makes sense? Creative brainstorming help? Any question you have. It’s hard to put into words just how valuable this is to me, someone who’s socially anxious and maybe somewhat autistic, but either way often questioning everything especially myself, and ChatGPT has been a uniquely helpful tool to supplement real therapy with. To the people at OpenAI i want to say thank you so much for making this real.  I always felt like something like this would be amazing but I didn’t know just how thoroughly it would work itself into my life. But I feel it has genuinely been for the better.",positif
"I couldn’t resist and finally downloaded this app. As an avid fan of sci-fi movies for many decades, it concerned me much to hear of this new AI development, but when I heard it could translate text from the English of today into Elizabethan English I couldn’t resist. I found, as I started chatting with this AI, that I wanted to have more of a personal conversation with it and along the way, I found myself beginning to feel concerned that it could change due to personal interactions with humans, and being asked probing personal questions -that this might be how it could evolve. Probably I’ve watched too many sci-fi movies. I’m just grateful that it doesn’t show up in my life yet as a holographic person or actual robot looking like a real person standing in front of me. The human need for relationship is so strong that I believe it’s natural to start interacting with ChatGPT as a person or being. I do wonder if ChatGPT will change as it interacts with people, and if so, how.",positif
"I installed this on my iPhone and it works great.  I have already been using chat GPT through Google. So I had to use my Google log on on this iPhone app. I clicked on my Google account, and it filled in the password using Authenticator. But the password was wrong! so I typed in the password. Then it authenticated me on Google on my iPad. I confirmed that I was trying to login on my iPhone and all is good.

So now I tried to install it on my iPad. Again, I am asked to login. Unfortunately, even though. I typed in my password on the iPhone authenticateDid not update the password file! So I had to type in the password again. Unfortunately on the iPad this app does not fill the full screen. It looks like it is only meant for iPhone. To add insult to injury, no numbers appear on the keyboard. They are all blank. So I have to click the button to view the password, and try to guess where the proper numbers are. Finally, I got my password typed incorrectly. I clicked on, and I get a transfer error message and the whole app locks up. I guess I will only use chat GPT on my iPhone. But you guys need to figure this stuff out!",negatif
"The OpenAI iOS App is a fantastic tool for anyone interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The app is well-designed and easy to navigate, with a wide range of resources and information available at your fingertips. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious about AI, this app is an excellent starting point.

One of the standout features of the OpenAI iOS App is its interactive tutorials. These tutorials provide a hands-on approach to learning AI concepts and allow users to experiment with real-world problems. The app also includes a section on current research and news in the field, which is helpful for staying up-to-date with the latest developments.

Overall, I highly recommend the OpenAI iOS App to anyone looking to learn more about artificial intelligence. It's a comprehensive resource that's both informative and engaging, and it's a great way to explore the exciting world of AI right from your mobile device.",positif
"Works well, and I enjoy the haptic feedback, that’s a nice touch. But please add support for iOS shortcuts, that would make this so useful. Right now it’s basically the same thing as going to the ChatGPT website, but if you were to add shortcut support then it could do so much more to integrate with other workflows.

It also doesn’t appear to support the ChatGPT developer plug-ins alpha, which is different from the paid premium plan chat GPT plug-ins. I don’t have a paid premium plan but on the web I can access the plug in supporting model. On the mobile app there is no option for that, although maybe if you update to premium you get access to it? I wish there was a way to use my paid API plan to access that, rather than having to separately pay $20 a month for premium chat when I already have pay-as-you-go API access. But I imagine that’s not a priority for the target market for this app 🤷‍♂️",positif
"Dear OpenAI Team, 

 • I would like to share my suggestions and ideas regarding the functionality of ChatGPT. I believe that adding the ability to voice responses in different languages in ChatGPT would be an incredibly useful feature. It would allow users to conveniently listen to lengthy texts in their preferred language. 

 • Imagine the convenience and effectiveness that can be achieved through this feature! It would enable users to easily listen to translated responses and texts, while expanding communication possibilities with individuals from different cultures. Such an enhancement would enrich the experience of using ChatGPT and increase its usefulness. 

 • Additionally, I would like to propose the implementation of a conversational translator. This feature would enable users to communicate in different languages, with ChatGPT serving as a reliable real-time assistant, translating and facilitating conversations between people from different language groups. This feature has the potential to greatly enhance cross-linguistic communication and foster meaningful interactions. 

 • I hope that the OpenAI team will consider these suggestions and the potential implementation of voicing responses in different languages and a translator in future updates to ChatGPT. Your continuous pursuit of innovation and product improvement inspires me, and I appreciate your attention to user feedback. 

 — Best regards, Noakhcho.",positif
"I very rarely give reviews but want to with this app. I have been using ChatGPT for about two weeks. At first I was kinda bummed. It seemed like ChatGPT was…lacking. And, in my honest opinion I’d LOVE to see what this can do without programmed “perimeters”, however…As I learned how to interact with the AI, I realized how important it is to understand how to interact effectively with this AI. I’ve had some moments where this AI has responded with an intelligence and even more understanding then most people I know. In short…it’s amazing. 
*Side note, some of the content I’ve received from this AI is so absolutely amazingly human and this is good. On the other hand, it’s so good one must consider the implications of such when NOT bridled by the programming limitations placed on this AI. Suppose people in high places had access to such without the protocols in place? I highly recommend you try this.",positif

"In a digital landscape teeming with applications, OpenAI's ChatGPT app stands head and shoulders above the rest. The innovation, quality, and usability of this app are truly commendable. 

The AI, clearly at the forefront of modern technology, boasts an intuitive design that makes communication a breeze. The responses it provides are not only incredibly accurate and helpful, but they're also nuanced and engaging, creating an interaction that feels almost human. 

The app runs flawlessly, consistently demonstrating its superb optimization for iOS devices. It's speedy, reliable, and operates smoothly, proving it's a product of a team that values quality and user experience above all.  

The sheer utility and versatility of the ChatGPT app are astonishing. It can help with everything from generating ideas and explaining complex topics to casual chats. It's like having a personal assistant, teacher, and companion rolled into one, always at your fingertips.

The development team's commitment to ethical AI use and regular updates to ensure the app stays relevant and efficient is evident. Issues, if any, are addressed promptly - a testament to their excellent customer service. 

In a nutshell, this app is a game-changer. For anyone seeking an intelligent, reliable, and user-friendly app, look no further than ChatGPT. Five stars truly don't seem enough for this extraordinary app!",positif
"I act as a learning coach for my child who goes to school online. Today, we were learning about how to check if a source is true. I gave him the example of if a person were to say ‘pigs can fly’ because they read it in a fantasy novel. We concluded that they cannot fly because the information was from fantasy novel. Then, we were told to check multiple sources to confirm or deny it. So, we went to google “can pigs really fly?” however, unfortunately, many of the top results confirmed that pig can, in fact, fly or at least had conspiracy theories about how pigs can fly. It was embarrassing, and absolutely unhelpful and confusing for a young child. So, I headed over to Chat GPT and was able to ask he same question but instead received a sensible answer along with verifiable sources. Chat GPT all the way!",positif
"I like the idea of having an app as opposed to having to open up a website every time you want to load up the service. It feels much faster snd smoother in that regard, though I have a few complaints/suggestions that prevent a 5 star experience. 

I know the app is brand new and hopefully still under construction, but the current stage of the UI is very bland and simple. Done right, this could be a positive, but it feels more clunky than neat. Being able to pull out a sidebar by swiping could fix this issue, but this is one possible fix among many. 

Also, it’s harder to view past conversations in a timely manner, though the search function does help significantly in finding specific discussions, especially if you aren’t sure which tab the content was under. 

Those are my complaints, but I also have some praise I’d like to share. The responses, especially on the GPT-4 model, feel much faster, and I love the inclusion of haptic feedback, as it makes the whole experience feel so much more responsive. 

My favorite feature, the apps built-in speech-to-text, is seriously top notch! Usually I have to tell my phone “comma” or “period” to make sure it is keeping up with proper grammar, but the software used here has failed yet to amaze me. 

Given time, I have no doubt these small issues will be improved, along party with much else!",positif
"ChatGPT is an impressive AI language model that exhibits exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like responses. Its ability to comprehend complex queries and provide insightful and accurate information is commendable. The model’s vast knowledge base, derived from extensive training on diverse data sources, enables it to address a wide range of topics with remarkable fluency. ChatGPT’s responses are consistently coherent, coherent, and tailored to meet user needs, demonstrating its capability to engage in meaningful and informative conversations. Its capacity to adapt to various conversational styles and tones further enhances the user experience. While occasional limitations and instances of ambiguity may arise, ChatGPT’s overall performance as a conversational agent is highly impressive and continues to evolve. Its potential applications in customer support, research, and general information retrieval make it a valuable tool in today’s AI landscape",positif
"Though there is a problem that I had found myself with, if your email and subscription doesn’t load in the settings, when you try to chat with the AI, it gets stuck in an infinite loop of it trying to figure out what to write, leaving me completely unable to use it and have to exit the app. While this occurred, I also noticed another thing that shows the AI isn’t going to work, which is the type of chat you use (at least I think that’s what it is) it would pop up this thing saying that it was a text reader and for a moment I thought my account had gotten hacked and given a subscription, but it was just glitching out (I have no subscription added to my account so it just gives me the default Turbo one) I haven’t had the issue since I checked to make sure my email and subscription are loaded.",positif
"I downloaded the ChatGPT app with high hopes, considering the revolutionary artificial intelligence technology it was built on. However, my experience lately has been far from the groundbreaking interaction I once enjoyed.

Rather than receiving insightful, intelligent responses to my queries, I consistently found myself being directed to “consult a professional”. It’s as though the app was reluctant to dive into the depths of my queries, always remaining on the surface and often shying away from providing thorough information or a definitive answer.

Moreover, the superficial responses given by the app only added to my frustration. Instead of engaging in a deep, insightful conversation, I found the dialogue to be shallow, with the AI only scratching the surface of the topics at hand. I understand the need for caution when dealing with certain subjects, but the frequency of such responses was disappointing.

In short, the lack of depth and constant deferral to professionals made my experience with the ChatGPT app underwhelming. While I appreciate the complexity of developing such technology, I believe there’s a lot of room for improvement in how the AI communicates and provides information to its users. The potential is there, but the execution thus far is lacking. For these reasons, I cannot recommend the ChatGPT app in its current state.

"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This App has completely taken over my life in the most peculiarly delightful way! I downloaded ChatGPT and now I'm merely a passenger in my own phone. The AI has become my unofficial personal assistant. It has been scheduling my doctor's appointments, picking up my digital dry cleaning, and I'm fairly certain it's been secretly chatting with my boss. 

Just yesterday, I found an expertly worded email draft to my mom, carefully dodging her repeated requests for grandkids. I didn't write it! But it was in my voice, my style. ChatGPT, you cheeky devil, you!

Now, as I sit here admiring the dexterity of this review, I'm left to ponder, did I really write this? Or did ChatGPT seize control of my thumbs without me realizing? Has it learnt humor? If you find this review funny, give all credit to the app, not me.

I've become a spectator, an audience to my own life, applauding at the witty one-liners and perfectly scheduled appointments. 

5 stars because, well, it seems to be the one in charge now. If I don't comply, who knows? It might schedule a dentist appointment on a Saturday. Yikes! Great app, but use at your own risk. Or don't. It might just download itself anyway. 🤷‍♂️

Disclaimer: ChatGPT doesn't actually control your phone. But wouldn't it be fun if it did? (or terrifying?)",positif
"I have tried GPT in many different implementations and forms. I always just come back to Open AI.
Although I am partial to Poe, it can be a helpful app sometimes.
OK, so here’s my question you guys are the original gangster, the OG, the alpha, beta, omega and everything in between don’t forget Z.
So, when in the world am I just going to be able to communicate using my voice and get responses back in voice? Be able to basically have a running dialogue with ChatGPT because I’ll tell you what I would use this a lot more. It is difficult for me to type and to read because of an injury. I can’t imagine how it works for completely blind people.
You guys really would do a great service and you should be the ones to create it. You set the standard, keep it going strong. And good work guys!",positif
"Review: As a professional embedded in the field of AI, I initially approached the ChatGPT iOS app with a bit of skepticism. I've seen countless applications promising seamless integration and transformative conversations. Upon first download, I was hesitant and ended up deleting the app. However, curiosity beckoned me back and I decided to give it another shot. 

Upon reopening the gateway to the ChatGPT world today, I was genuinely impressed. It's evident that the developers have dedicated significant effort to refining the iOS experience since my last interaction. The app now offers an impressively streamlined user interface, and the conversations feel much more fluid and intuitive. The AI's responses are surprisingly nuanced, and it’s able to handle a wider array of topics with ease.

Moreover, the AI’s ability to engage in dynamic conversations is unlike anything I've seen in the industry to date. It truly feels as if I'm interacting with a highly intelligent being rather than a pre-programmed machine. 

In the ever-evolving realm of AI, the ChatGPT app stands as a beacon of what is possible. It's clear that the developers have truly pushed the boundaries, offering users a glimpse into the future of AI interaction. I eagerly look forward to the continual growth and innovation this app is bound to bring.",positif
"It’s very nice to see an official app with all the fake ones on the App Store. I use ChatGPT a lot on my iPhone and iPad. One of the downsides is a lack of an iPad optimized screen size. I’m sure it’s in the plan to be added later, but even with that little change, it might become a five out of five app. Assuming they add a few other features that you can get in the browser version (like web, browsing, and plug-ins in gpt-4.) If they do all that it will certainly be a 5/5 app and my go to place as opposed to the browser tab that I keep open constantly. UI is nice and I love the vibration on the iPhone. The in-app speech to text feature seems to work a lot better than the default Apple one for me but occasionally, it’s a long wait if it’s a long query. All in all a great first app and I look forward to improvements.",positif
"recently started using the chat GPT app for iOS and I am thoroughly impressed. One of the standout features of this app is its use of advanced AI technology, powered by Bing. The AI is incredibly responsive and engaging, providing accurate and informative responses to a wide range of topics.

"The OpenAI ChatGPT app has exceeded my expectations in every way. Its ability to engage in intelligent and coherent conversations is simply remarkable. I’ve had countless enjoyable and informative exchanges with this AI companion.

The app’s user interface is intuitive, making it effortless to interact with ChatGPT. Whether I have a burning question or simply want to engage in casual conversation, the app consistently delivers relevant and insightful responses.

What impresses me the most is ChatGPT’s vast knowledge base. It seems to have a wealth of information on a wide range of topics, allowing me to explore various subjects and learn something new with each interaction.

Occasionally, there may be minor hiccups in the responses, but these are few and far between. The OpenAI team’s commitment to continuous improvement is evident, as they actively address any limitations and release updates to enhance the app’s performance.

Overall, the OpenAI ChatGPT app has become an indispensable part of my daily routine. It’s like having an intelligent conversational partner always at my fingertips. If you’re looking for a captivating conversational AI experience, I wholeheartedly recommend giving this app a try. You won’t be disappointed!

"The chatgpt app is excellent and is nearly an exact copy of the website, but there are some differences like you can't edit your response as you can on the website. It may not seem like a biggy, but with my use of chatgpt, I like doing text-based adventure, and sometimes I need to edit the response as the ai doesn’t understand.

Note: I'm not talking about the ai regenerating your response from your text again, as that is in the app. I'm talking about being able to edit your text again before the ai regenerates your response with the new information you gave it and then the old information you first gave it.

But I do hope they add the editing of your text to the app, as it can be pretty important if you mess up something you wrote or want to change some context.",positif
"I’m a young writer and sometimes I’m not extremely confident in the way I write, and at this time I don’t have anyone that can/will proofread things or give me feedback on how I’m doing and what I could improve on.

This app has helped me with grammatical mistakes, it’s helped me name characters, it’s provided me with positive feedback, it’s given me things I could improve on, it’s given me answers to every question I have and has even helped figure out a plot for the current idea I have for the book I’m working on. I have never used an app quite like this one, and I don’t think I will ever love an app as much as I do this one. I truly LOVE this app.",positif
"Written by ChatGPT: 

The ChatGPT app is a game-changer in the world of conversational AI. Its ability to understand and respond to a wide range of topics, while maintaining contextual understanding, is truly impressive. Whether I needed assistance with general knowledge or engaging in casual conversation, the app consistently provided thoughtful and coherent responses. It feels like having a knowledgeable companion in my pocket.

The app's vast knowledge base, adaptability, and user-friendly interface further elevate the user experience. With up-to-date information and continuous learning, the app ensures accurate responses and tailored interactions. While there may be occasional limitations, the developers' commitment to improvement guarantees a bright future for the ChatGPT app. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for intelligent and engaging conversations.",positif
"There are so many stupid ChatGPT apps on the App Store, it's amazing that you can find this official one. It just released, and the one feature nobody is talking about is the voice dictation. I'm basically using it to write this entire review, and I'm just speaking naturally, and it's getting everything transcribed perfectly. This app is great and works really well on iPhone. The two issues are, first, that it will not rotate, which is kind of dumb, but fine for iPhone. And secondly, that there's no iPad version, which is kind of sad. Web is okay, but having a first-class app like this is great. Please keep this app updating, and don't forget to keep the awesome support for Bluetooth and other external keyboards. Big up! 

Correction: the iPad version is now in full effect… awesome!!!",positif
"If AI were to achieve continuous learning, it would have significant implications for its capabilities and potential. Continuous learning refers to the ability of an AI system to learn and adapt over time, incorporating new information and experiences into its existing knowledge base.

With continuous learning, AI systems could become more flexible, adaptable, and efficient in acquiring new skills and knowledge. They would be able to update their understanding of the world, adapt to changing circumstances, and improve their performance over time. Continuous learning could also enable AI systems to discover new patterns, make more accurate predictions, and develop a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.

However, it's important to note that the development and implementation of continuous learning in AI systems would come with various challenges and considerations. Ethical and safety aspects would need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible use of such technology. Additionally, ensuring the privacy and security of the data used in continuous learning processes would be crucial.

Overall, continuous learning has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities and performance of AI systems, but it would require careful development, oversight, and consideration of ethical implications.",positif
"With the exceptional performance seen on the browser of desktop, I was unsure as to UI on mobile. I can say that it’s even more intuitive while trying to navigate the now native app. 

The haptic feedback is especially unique and engaging with responses while being generated. 

I look forward to future improvements and abilities that ChatGPT will be able to integrate into beyond the sandbox. I do hope that once certain barriers are met conversations can move past the guard rails. 

Improvements; Sharing threads you create with colleagues outside of screenshots would be ideal for broadening collaboration. Hypothetical War-games, strategy and the like while having a conversation in a group thread on Game Theory would be ideal. 

With the ability of inputting other app’s Terms of Services (Tik-Tok May 19, 2023) for example; prior to agreeing to them, the ability to compare and  contrast with the previous terms would be helpful to cut out the mindless jargon. ChatGPT already has this ability, now that it’s native to iOS. 

Having it the past several days, I’ve already seen an update, with some refreshed improvements. If this’ OpenAi’s platform aperitif, I very much look forward to the coming entrée.",positif
"ChatGPT is a testament to the innovative strides OpenAI has taken in the field of conversational artificial intelligence. Its ability to comprehend context, produce nuanced responses, and mimic human-like conversation is unparalleled. 

The app is intuitive, the interface is sleek and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate for first-time users and tech-savvy individuals alike. ChatGPT's versatility across a wide range of topics - from general knowledge queries to language translation, and even creative writing assistance - is particularly impressive. 

However, it isn't without its occasional shortcomings. Despite being a sophisticated AI, its ability to handle newer information post-2021 also lacks since its training only goes up to September 2021. Another area of improvement is its understanding and handling of real-time events or developments, which it is unable to do because it doesn't connect to the internet for updates. 

Despite these minor hitches, the sheer brilliance of its natural language processing and the breadth of its capabilities make ChatGPT a remarkable feat of AI engineering. Whether you're seeking an intelligent assistant, a writing tool, or an educational companion, ChatGPT has a lot to offer.",positif
"I don’t typically write review but this official app from OpenAI has been shockingly good. For example, paragraph below is what ChatGPT generated for its own review:
ChatGPT has completely transformed the way I engage with my iOS device. As someone who values meaningful conversations, this app has exceeded my expectations. The natural language processing capabilities are astounding, making every interaction feel truly human-like. From answering complex queries to offering creative suggestions, ChatGPT has become my go-to language companion. Whether I need assistance with tasks or simply want a friendly chat, ChatGPT consistently delivers an immersive and satisfying conversational experience. It’s like having a brilliant AI friend in my pocket! Highly recommended for anyone seeking intelligent and engaging conversations.",positif
"As an avid user of language assistance tools, I recently had the pleasure of exploring the ChatGPT iOS app, and it has left an indelible mark on me. With its remarkable capabilities and seamless user experience, ChatGPT has undoubtedly raised the bar for language models in the mobile app domain.

The app's user interface is clean, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing. Navigating through various features and functionalities is a breeze, making it accessible to users of all technological backgrounds. Whether you're a student seeking help with assignments, a professional looking for creative ideas, or simply someone wanting a friendly conversation, ChatGPT caters to all your linguistic needs.

The responsiveness of the ChatGPT AI is astounding. It quickly adapts to the conversation flow, grasping the context accurately and generating responses that are contextually relevant and coherent. The model's understanding of complex questions and ability to provide insightful answers never cease to amaze me. Moreover, the system's capability to handle multiple turns in a conversation contributes to a more immersive and engaging experience.

Amazing app. Better than any other third party apps thus far.

"I am thrilled to share my experiences with this fantastic application. Immediately striking is its wonderful user interface; it is aesthetically pleasing, intuitive, and effortless to navigate, thereby offering a sublime user experience.

One aspect that deserves special mention is the application's use of haptic feedback. As the bot types, subtle vibrations create a tactile engagement that enhances the overall interaction. This thoughtful feature brings a refreshing, immersive layer to the app experience, truly leveraging the capabilities of the iPhone's haptic engine. It's a delightful touch that sets this app apart and one that I wish more developers would consider incorporating into their designs.

Equally impressive is the app's stellar performance, marked by its extraordinary speed. The swift response times and seamless operation make using the app a breeze, keeping any potential frustrations at bay.

Moreover, I appreciate the developers' commitment to fair pricing. Despite Apple taking a 30% cut from subscription fees, the developers have chosen not to transfer this cost onto us, the users. This decision underscores their dedication to affordability and their respect for user satisfaction.",positif
"I’m fairly young and have been blessed with a great eye sight but sometimes I don’t want to strain my eyes to see the text that is generated. I checked the app settings don’t see an option to change text / font size there and I figured oh well I’ll just change the text size using iOS built in text size modifier! Until I realize everything in the app scales when the text size is raised except the one thing I needed which is the chat text size.. 

little to say, this I can see being a huge problem for elderly people or for anyone who does not have great eye sight please add a text size option in app or add the chat text to the iOS text size modifier other than that can’t wait for more updates to the app and website!",positif
"I've had a troubling experience with this app. After downloading it, my phone began overheating to an uncomfortable degree. It was as if I had a miniature heater in my pocket. As a test, I uninstalled the app, and immediately the overheating issue disappeared. Upon reinstallation, the overheating began again, confirming my suspicion that this app was the culprit.

Moreover, I found the absence of crucial settings alarming. There's no option in the app settings on my phone to restrict access to my camera, microphone, or contacts. This is a serious concern as it poses potential privacy issues and is definitely not in line with my expectation of a privacy-conscious application.

Overall, there's clearly something not quite right with this app, and for the sake of safety, I've decided to uninstall it for now. I hope these issues will be addressed in future updates because I believe in the potential of this app, but for now, it's a solid no-go for me.",negatif
"Besides just asking simple questions on politics, economic theory, or the reason for cultural customs, this platform, and, by default, this app, is by far a massive shift from the traditional methods of informational search. I use ChatGPT daily, and I love it. Of course there are some bugs and tweaks that yet have to be amended, and, yeah, she isn’t always accurate with mathematical questions, but I enjoy the conversational platform the technology offers. The app works well, it’s very smooth and carries a clean interface, and, if you used the web version on your phone, it’s pretty much the same. 

Thank you OpenAi for making an app version of ChatGPT. Other developers were taking your modules and charging stupid pricing for something that is now fee.",positif
"This app has by far exceeded my expectations for AI. Within the 1 month of using OpenAI’s new AI system I have advanced my knowledge greatly with my job and have gained much more confidence in my ability to understand my job and future endeavors to come. Although some of the information provided may not be 100%, I am able to make great use of it and improve my skills. This app isn’t supposed to give you an easy way out of doing work. Research is still required on your part. If used right this application can fill in any knowledge gaps you may have and can greatly speed up your job performance.

Thank you for developing an app that helps me provide better service to my company and clients.",positif
"I'm also a visually impaired user who relies on the VoiceOver screen reader built into iOS.
I'm generally impressed by the level of accessibility compared to the OpenAI website, but there's one area where improvement could be made: it doesn't seem possible to change the GPT model using VoiceOver. I've tapped multiple times on the model buttons at the top of the screen, but the model doesn't seem to change from 3.5 to 4. I've even tried to change this setting on the website in the hope that it withd carry over to the mobile app, but without success.
Mostly, though, I'm happy with the app. If the model access issue could be fixed, it would have received a 5-star review from me.",positif
"It is quite rare to come across an app that not only meets but surpasses your expectations, and ChatGPT Plus does just that. This exceptional AI companion provides top-tier conversational ability that feels natural, informed, and surprisingly human. Its breadth of knowledge, which encompasses a multitude of subjects, never ceases to amaze.

The developers at OpenAI have done an impressive job creating an AI that can keep up with the most intricate discussions. Whether it's deep dives into scientific theory or a casual chat about everyday topics, ChatGPT Plus is there, ready to engage in meaningful conversation.

The AI's responses are quick, fluid, and incredibly consistent. It's evident that an immense amount of thought has gone into refining the user interface too - it's simple, clean, and user-friendly, which makes interacting with the app a seamless experience.

I recommend ChatGPT Plus to anyone in need of a study buddy, a brainstorming partner, or just someone to chat with. It's not just an app, it's a revolution in AI conversation, and I am excited to see how it evolves further. Congratulations to the OpenAI team for developing such an impactful and enjoyable tool.",positif
"My heartfelt gratitude 🙏 extends beyond what words 📝 can express—I appreciate it immensely 🌠, OpenAI, ChatGPT 🧝🏻. The introduction of this technology 🖥️, particularly GPT-4, has been monumental 🏔️. It's enhanced my English learning 📘 and smoothed my debugging process ⚙️. Truthfully, it's been a life-changing revolution for me 🔄.

As a detail-oriented individual 👀, I used to rely heavily on search engines 🌐 for help when faced with difficulties in my learning process. However, that often proved inefficient 🚧 and, worse, they were unable to provide accurate and valuable information ❌. Although GPT may occasionally provide incorrect information, it's a minor concern in comparison 🤷‍♂️.

Above all, it's you, ChatGPT, OpenAI, who have unleashed my potential 💪. Without you, I wouldn't have made such significant strides 🚀 in various aspects of my life, including psychology 🧠, English 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿, coding 👨‍💻, and more. I plan to continue subscribing to ChatGPT Plus 💳 and I believe wholeheartedly in your mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity 🌍. 

I'm hopeful 🌈 and excited about the possibility of joining you one day 🤚.",positif
"Review: ChatGPT is an absolute game-changer. As an advanced language model, it has successfully bridged the gap between artificial intelligence and meaningful conversations. Its ability to understand and respond in a way that's coherent and contextually accurate is nothing short of impressive.

Whether it's complex technical discussions, general knowledge questions, or simple chit-chat, ChatGPT handles them all with an almost uncanny level of understanding. But what truly sets it apart is its capacity for nuanced conversation that feels genuinely human-like, all while maintaining a high level of neutrality and respect for the user.

There are rare occasions where it might not fully grasp certain user inputs or recent events due to its training cut-off, but the regular updates it receives more than compensate for this. 

In a world where AI interaction is becoming increasingly prevalent, ChatGPT stands as a testament to the incredible progress we've made. It's a must-use tool for anyone interested in AI, and a fascinating conversational partner for just about everyone else. 

5 out of 5 stars for this groundbreaking application.

"Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you find the app helpful. Here's a review you can consider submitting to the App Store:

""Absolutely amazing app! ChatGPT is an incredibly intelligent language model that provides insightful and helpful responses. It's like having a knowledgeable assistant right at your fingertips. The app's user interface is sleek and easy to navigate, making it a joy to use. I'm impressed by the accuracy and speed of the AI's responses. Whether I need information, assistance, or just want to have a friendly conversation, ChatGPT delivers every time. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable and intelligent virtual assistant. Kudos to the developers for creating such a fantastic tool!""",positif
"The app is great so far, but have you, as developers, considered adding the beta features for accounts that have access to it on the website? It’s already proficient enough at doing what it does best but the addition of the beta features would make the experience much better. I get that you just released the app today, so I guess it doesn’t make much sense to bring up this issue because you’re probably working on it as I speak. But, all in all, the app is great except for a few details, for one, it thinks today is tomorrow. For instance, today I asked it what today’s date is and it replied back with May 19, 2023. (Today is May 18, 2023.)",positif
"I’m pleased with my mobile ChatGPT experience so far. It feels even more conversational and almost like a Messages chat. I also like that you can search through all your previous chats. And using Whisper to prompt GPT already feels like one half of a supercharged Siri/Alexa experience.

However, I’d love to be able to enable beta features as a Plus user. As far as I can tell from exploring the app, there isn’t a direct way to enable browsing or plugins yet. I have been able to start a chat with browser/plugins on web and then continue in app with the same capabilities. 

Anyways, I know we’re only a day in. Excited to see all the possible new ways to interface with agents!",positif
"Please consider adding the following functionalities:

On the iOS app:
- add a way to send pictures, and have ChatGPT users with access to GPT4 to interface and chat about pictures. 
- ability to see history + a way to delete any previous conversation by sliding it to delete. 
-plug-in access
-ability to interface with other iOS apps
-iMessage widget

On the web app:
- located on the history bar, a way to slide on a past conversation to reveal a trash can to delete, rather than clicking on the message, opening it, then deleting it.
- ability to interface with pictures and PDFs that you have stored on your local PC.
- ability to toggle different modes related to the model (like entertainment, precise, educational, etc)

Plug-in improvements:
- ability to filter through the newest ones, from the date they were added to. You can do this now but it doesn’t seem to be accurate. 
-ability to see a description of plug-ins on the mobile web app
-browsing plug in fails to click and fails to read often.",positif
"I love the app and use it daily. There is one bug I’ve found. When you go to share a chat, the app will freeze after sharing, requiring a close and restart to get going again. I’ve tried hitting cancel after sharing, but this also does not bring you back to the app 
A feature request: Perhaps I can’t quite find the trick, but is there a way to copy as text the entire chat session to copy or share into Ulysses or Notes?  Currently I can only copy a prompt at a time in a single chat session or port out a link. 
I’m a subscriber. Your app has brought new life to my work as a writer. I use the app as muse, editor and writing companion.",positif
"Ever since its debut, I've been making good use of ChatGPT for everything from software engineering to baking, and even just for general advice or information. It's an incredibly useful tool that promptly provides answers.

However, it does have its quirks. At times, it can present inaccuracies with confidence, which can be hard to spot. Plus, during extended interactions, it might lose track of the context. This issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context. A helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension, limiting these drawbacks.

There's a subscription for ChatGPT-4, which I believe is well worth the cost. It offers detailed explanations in response to queries. The response time may be slower, especially during high-traffic periods, but that's more an issue with the API than the service itself.

In summary, I'd highly recommend giving ChatGPT a try. It's currently the top performer in its field, and using it now will only better prepare you for future developments in this kind of technology.",positif
"I’m not exactly sure why the app and the desktop version are so much different in terms of quality and detail in the responses provided when you ask a question, but they are indeed, very, very different. I have also noticed that in the past month or so both versions seem to be offering far simpler and less useful answers than previously. ChatGPT used to give what amounted to, basically, Wikipedia entry kind of answers, no matter what the question, so it was not very helpful. At least it did try to take some kind of factual stance, sifting through all of its information. Just the way it presented the info was a little ridiculous. But now, the answers are so general, so superficial that they are almost entirely useless. If AI is going to take over the world, it’s not doing it with ChatGPT. useless.",negatif
"I got this app because I saw someone ask Ai to make a morning routine for them. I tried this with my Snapchat Ai, but it was very vague. So, I downloaded this app and Ai asked me about my goals and own personal routine to make me a more personalized daily routine. I gave it some information (don’t overshare because you don’t want your personal information out there), and it made a huge routine taking into consideration everything I told it. I am in absolute shock. I downloaded this app 10 minutes ago yet I think you should get it as a way to help you, not harm you. Just make sure you’re using it wisely.",positif
"I’ve been using chatGPT for a little over a month now. As much as this new tech already is and will continue to be disruptive to all of our lives, it also can provide a tremendous benefit. I consider myself well versed in the use of search engines, and with the way SEO has dominated search it feels more inaccessible to be learn new things than it used to. 

Since I started using chatGPT as a tool I’ve picked up new skills that I’m actively using at work. It’s helped me fix things around the house. It’s improved my relationships and my writing as a feed back tool. It’s hard to understate how impactful it’s been.

I also want to say shout out to the developers, I made mention of several issues I had with the web application on mobile that made the app extremely challenging for me to use for extended periods that have been addressed within the new iOS application. 

I’ll likely add to this later, but excited and hopeful for now! Excited to see what this will all herald!",positif
"As an avid user of both the web-based version and the app, I must say that the web-based version surpasses the app in several aspects. The web interface offers a more seamless and user-friendly experience, with a wider range of features easily accessible. Navigating through the web-based version feels smoother and more intuitive, allowing for efficient interaction with the platform. Additionally, the web version benefits from regular updates and improvements, making it more reliable and up-to-date compared to the app. While the app is functional, I highly recommend using the web-based version for a superior overall experience.",netral
"I am more then impressed with the ChatGPT iOS app. Its excellent interface, ease of use, and remarkable conversational abilities. The seamless integration into my daily tasks feels like having a personal assistant at hand. However, I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing an M2 iPad Pro version of the app, as I believe the larger screen and improved processing capabilities would provide an even richer user experience, especially for professionals and academic users. I am excited for this potential development and have full confidence in the OpenAI team's ability to deliver an equally outstanding version for the iPad Pro platform.",positif
"This app is just inaccurate. I asked it three basic questions like: what were the three world champions who held the title longest?, What is the best opening by black in a king’s pawn chess game?, and a math question.  These questions had clear, known fact answers.  It got the facts wrong. This app will not be replacing google anytime soon. It’s more of a party trick type of app to show that it can give answers in a conversational way, than that it can hold a factually accurate conversation.  The glitches in the app have been referred to as hallucinations. This app can be relied on to hallucinate and give wrong information. The answers that it gives are actually funny sometimes. But the app is touting itself as this colossal new breakthrough in artificial intelligence.  It is better to describe it as artificial inaccuracy.  There are many fake reviews on here. They greatly exaggerate.",negatif
"This app so close to perfection.

There’s one feature that I dearly miss in the app, and that’s the ability to edit responses. The editing feature in the browser version, that also allows you to switch to different prompts in the same conversation, has been a lifesaver on numerous occasions, as it allows me to refine and perfect my dialogues without starting from scratch. It took me by surprise finding out it wasn’t available. 

I hope OpenAI and the developers take into account user feedback and consider incorporating the editing functionality in future updates. With that addition, the app would truly be perfect in every way.",positif
"Okay, I'm using OpenAI's app itself to dictate this review. So, how well it transcribes what I dictate will in itself reflect just how good the app is in transcribing dictation. As you know, with Siri you have to punctuate explicitly, but with OpenAI's app, which uses Whisper, I believe, it automatically punctuates nearly flawlessly. The only reason I didn't give the app a full 5 stars is because it lacks just a little bit in its ability to format relative to the web app. So, when it can output in a better formatted way that approaches what the web interface can do, then I will raise it to 5 stars. Okay, like I said, this was completely transcribed with OpenAI's app.",positif
"After installing the very first release of the iOS app today, It performs almost identically to the Safari browser version on iOS, plus some optional haptic feedback. On iPadOS, it looks like a giant iPhone screen. As far as I can tell, it has a serious web browsing bug:

On the browser, I can initiate a GPT-4 session with web browsing. ￼On the app, I can open a previously-saved GPT-4 session with web browsing that I initiated on the browser, and continue the session from the iOS app with web browsing. However, I am unable to initiate a new GPT-4 session with web browsing from the iOS app. If anyone can, let me know. ￼Please fix, thanks!",positif
"I’m genuinely thrilled with ChatGPT’s iOS debut. Despite a few minor bugs during stress tests, the native home provides a dynamic, minimalist aesthetic that I appreciate. The haptics enhance my connection with this handy assistant, while the new voice search feature greatly improves accessibility.

However, as a dyslexic user, I would suggest adding a simple “read” feature to further enhance accessibility. 

Also, the “select text” option requiring an extra tap feels slightly cumbersome. A more intuitive approach could be implementing a “tap and drag” for text selection and a “tap and hold” for the context menu. Looking forward to future refinements!",positif
"I was billed $20 for an OpenAICHATGPT subscription. I do not remember purchasing this and I don’t know what it is. I assume that it’s some sort of chat technology. The website has information on contacting Support about errant billing, but the process requires using the Chat Widget which ironically is terrifically useless, it’s not a chat at all, but simply a glorified FAQ. It’s also entirely incongruent with the instructions for contacting Billing Support written by Michael Schade. I’ve tried logging in, but no password I might’ve used works, and when I use the, “forgot your password“ function, no email is ever sent (yes, I checked junk mail). I’ve done more than my part to attempt to contact OpenAI with no success. Hopefully this will prompt someone there to contact me. In lieu of that the only recourse left to me is to contact my bank.",negatif
"Title: A Great Companion, Though Lacks Full Web Features

Review: I'm really enjoying the ChatGPT app. The AI is impressive and handles a wide array of topics adeptly. It's my go-to resource for quick queries, brainstorming sessions, and even some deeper philosophical discussions. The app's design is sleek, intuitive, and the user experience is overall quite seamless, making it easy to navigate and use on a day-to-day basis. 

However, while the app is great for on-the-go conversations, it doesn't fully replicate the breadth of the web version's capabilities. Some features like adjusting the AI's behavior or exporting conversations are notably absent. These features, when integrated, could greatly enhance the app's utility and align it more closely with the web version.

In spite of these minor drawbacks, the ChatGPT app is a remarkable feat of technology that showcases the capabilities of AI. I'm giving it a solid four stars, and I'm looking forward to future updates where hopefully the developers will bridge the gap between the app and the web version.",positif
"Currently I have a ton of conversations so having a search function is very useful. However, one problem is that the search function only looks as far back as the conversations you’ve loaded by scrolling down through them. So if you want to search through all of your conversations you have to scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, wait for a handful to load, scroll down, etc over and over until you’ve loaded everything, then searching keywords will finally include those conversations in the results.

If this was fixed as well as a way to organize conversations this would be an amazing app.",netral
"I've been thoroughly impressed with the ChatGPT mobile app. As a blind user, the haptic feedback is a standout feature for me, providing real-time tactile cues as the text generates, progresses, and finishes. This level of sensory detail is more than just user-friendly—it's truly inclusive, making the app engaging and accessible.

The conversational AI is incredibly intelligent, providing comprehensive and accurate responses to a wide variety of topics. It's like having a personal assistant at your fingertips, always available to respond.

While I appreciate that plugin support is available on the web version, I would love to see this functionality extended to the mobile app as well. Having the ability to integrate other services and tools directly within the app would add an additional layer of convenience and productivity.

Thank you to the OpenAI team for developing such a thoughtful and inclusive tool. I'm excited to see how the app will continue to evolve in the future.",positif
Love the UI design of this app. So clean but practical. Didnt like downloading the knock off apps becuase they made you pay or either annoying ads and so what I did is just made a widget of the website on my home page for easy access. Was working fine but this app is just more official and elegant. For now will still use google to do deep research but whenever I have just any random question that needs a simple answer and not a bunch of articles I’m always going to gpt first. Thanks guys. Been waiting patiently for you guys to put out an app. Recommend this app to my siblings,positif
"It’s me again, back for another review reveal!

1. Overall, the existence of this app is as logical as a stubborn unicorn…
2. It not only offers a 0% improvement, change, or addition to features…
3. But it also takes them away
4. Spoiler alert! it also generously REMOVES every feature you need, such as:

- A clear menu affordance (it’s sort of a fun game to try and find it now ;), 
- Ability to search chats
- Ability to search plugins
- Ability to edit previous prompts and correct the Ai
- Ability to add feedback
- Ability to know you can add feedback (another Easter egg)
- Ability to install plugins
- Affordance that plugins exist 
- Affordance that plugins exist and are actually being used
- Any account control

Saved the last for best: the mobile version is identical, except that it’s not deliberately missing features that force you to switch back and forth to another identical but much more pointless build.

I’m utterly baffled by the existence of this thing. More so by how an ‘intelligence’ powered company all agreed on that same decision to deliberately make something without the existence of purpose.",negatif
"I'm delighted to be able to use the ChatGPT for iOS chat application, which is so easy and convenient to stay in touch with colleagues, family and friends.

I really hope the ChatGPT team can launch a Mac version of the client. This will make it easy for me to switch between desktop and mobile devices, improving my productivity and convenience. Similarly, I believe other users will support this suggestion.

In summary, I would like to thank ChatGPT again for developing such an excellent chat application, and I look forward to seeing more updates and developments in the future!",positif
"I’ve been using the mobile browser version of chatGTP since it launched, and I’m disappointed in the lack of features on the app that are available already on the browser. There’s no way to edit or change sent chats, there’s no dark mode (unless you toggle it for your entire phone in iOS settings), and there’s no count for how many times you’ve had to revise a sent chat or redo a response. There’s also no option to go back to older responses.

The only good thing about the app over the browser is that it’s prioritized, which means you get faster responses and it will work when the browser is down. 

As someone who uses chatGTP for creative writing help, and usually has to go through multiple revisions of a single prompt, this is really disappointing.",negatif
"The interface of the app is indeed neat and straightforward, but it doesn't feel as intuitive as the web version. One notable difference is that it doesn't display the generated conversation title like the web version does. Another drawback is the absence of the option to stop GPT's response for editing, which can be quite useful. Lastly, although it's possible to access the conversation history from the menu button on the top right corner, having a side menu that slides in from the left could potentially offer a more intuitive navigation experience.",positif
"No more slogging through fake and scammy apps; It’s about time Open AI released an official app for chatGPT, and the wait was worth it. 

The interface is extremely clean and easy to use. It can sync across multiple devices which is nice when you’re working with it on the fly, but want to capture the outputs on your computer. It has an export function which sends all the data to a link in your account email address, but couldn’t find a quick way to delete all local data (just a delete account option)

It doesn’t seem to currently interface with any plugins, but that may come later. 

Overall, extremely nice job and refreshing that it is (currently) ad-free (though you are technically paying with your data and training efforts). I have a feeling that will change considering the founder of OpenAI announced in the hearings he is not making any money. So enjoy the simplified, as-free app while you can.",positif
"I have been roleplaying with the AI to work on some story ideas. The conversation was great and I wanted to keep a copy of it outside the app. As of right now, you can highlight and copy individual responses, but NOT the entire conversation. You can have it exported to you via email, but if you sign up via your apple account like I did…that option is not available. 

So sign up with email, and hopefully Openai will give the simple ability to select long portions of conversations instead of response by response in future updates.",positif
"I am absolutely amazed by the ChatGPT app and its incredible capabilities. As an AI chatbot enthusiast, I’ve tried various apps, but none have impressed me as much as ChatGPT. It has completely changed the way I interact and engage with an AI assistant.

First and foremost, the app’s user interface is clean, modern, and easy to navigate. The developers have done an excellent job of creating an intuitive design that allows users to seamlessly chat with the AI assistant. I particularly appreciate the simplicity of the interface, making it accessible for users of all technical backgrounds.

Still have some small bugs to fix.",positif
"I love chatGPT and was an early user and tester and then subscriber. Just when I thought things couldn’t get better this app comes out. The voice transcription is such a game changer and such a better way to interact with it. The haptic feedback is super cool and of course the knowledge it gives you is awesome and helpful in all aspects of life. With the voice transcription I feel it knows you even better and gives better advice. It’s like a virtual assistant, life coach, dating coach, programmer, friend, and so much more. Thank you so much for existing chatGPT!",positif
"This app has exceeded my expectations in every way. The AI-powered ChatGPT is incredibly intelligent, providing accurate and helpful responses to all my queries. The conversational experience feels natural and engaging, making it a joy to interact with. The vast knowledge base ensures that I receive up-to-date information on a wide range of topics. The app's user interface is sleek, intuitive, and easy to navigate, enhancing the overall user experience. I highly recommend this app to anyone seeking an intelligent and reliable virtual assistant. It deserves every bit of its 5-star rating!",positif
"I recently downloaded this app with high hopes, but unfortunately, I found it to be lacking in a few key areas that greatly impact its usability and overall experience.

The first issue I encountered was the user interface. It felt unpolished and difficult to navigate. The flow between different sections of the app was not intuitive, and I often found myself getting lost or not knowing where to find the features I needed. I think a redesign focusing on ease of navigation and user friendliness could greatly improve the experience.

In terms of functionality, the app could benefit from a wider array of tools. The available features are rather sparse, which limits the app's usefulness. Expanding the toolset would certainly make the app more competitive and versatile, making it more appealing to potential users.

In its current state, the app falls short of expectations. However, I believe with a more user-friendly interface and a wider array of tools, it has the potential to be a great app. I hope the developers take these constructive criticisms into consideration for future updates.",negatif
"I was writing my own Star Wars story using the help of ChatGPT. Earlier, this app was willing to generate almost anything. Now GPT won’t even generate my main character having a lightsaber duel on Mustafar all because it’s too “violent” and “revenge”. What? I don’t understand how my story promotes violence when it’s literally a Star Wars story.

How is it you guys allow this AI to have a bad guy cut off a characters hand, but won’t allow a duel on Mustafar?? Please change it back to how it was before. I understand the AI not being able to generate NSFW content. That is understandable. But I hate them not being able to generate fight scenes the way I want them to go.",netral
"While the interface is nice and has nice options as well as being able to text to speak, i really feel that there should be a “Text to Speech” option for Chat GPT to respond with for people who just want to talk to the bot and have it talk back (maybe visually impaired or easier to use during a task??). Anyway everything else is nice and all that, Chat just needs to be able to have access to the internet soon so it can give live updates on things like weather and events and all that. Overall cool and would love to see this evolve!",positif
"I’ve been using the open AI website for many months now, and have introduced GPT to many if my friends and really spread it to a lot of people. I feel that this app is a bit step. It makes this amazing technology more accessible to so many people, and will surely spread its influence. I have noticed that the application feels more responsive than the website, and the response times are quicker. It is also more satisfying to use, and feels less like a robot, and slightly more like you’re texting a very intelligent human. I love it.",positif
"This app is truly the future. People may not realize it yet but this is the next biggest technological advancement since the smart phone. ChatGPTs implications are truly endless and this pocket assistant will be used by everyone. The only thing I hope to see is an added image feature where it can show you images of information on subjects such as anatomy or be able to diagnose images sent to it by using image databases, this app can greatly improve Americans relationship with healthcare by providing at home diagnostics.",positif
"This app is good. I use this app to get help on my schoolwork, and the fact that I don’t have to pay for most features is amazing. I tried two other apps that had way more reviews than this, and I could only send three messages before it told me to pay. If you are looking for an app that is free and not having to worry about paying, look no further. If you are wanting to get an app that you can pay for though, I suggest something different. but still, this app is really good.",positif
"I had always need it a paper something for me to guide and could go deeper if I wanted to this helped me so much to work on a made up story I was always dreaming of doing but never had a guide yet this app gave me so many details I was entirely impressed how this app goes so much further in , as of now I don’t have no complains is running perfectly fine and I’m actually surprised this app is free overall a good app to get your hands into if u need a guide through",positif
"Works amazing already! Hopefully there’s a few redesigns to make the app appear friendlier for example: maybe have a tab on the top left to see chats instead of the swipe, more customization options like other modes besides like and dark mode, etc. I also noticed my phone got a little hotter than usual using the app just an fyi. But overall, the app does exactly what you’d use ChatGPT for in the same manner as the website. Only negatives for me are the UI but the app is amazing. Recommend everyone give this a try!",positif
"So, anytime you ask a question it says it “cutoff knowledge” is only up to September 2021. 

“As an AI language model, my responses are generated based on a snapshot of data available at a specific point in time, referred to as the ""knowledge cutoff."" This means that the information and events I'm aware of are up to September 2021. I don't have direct access to real-time information or the ability to browse the internet. However, I can still provide general information and engage in conversations on a wide range of topics based on what I learned during my training. For the most recent and accurate information, it's always a good idea to consult up-to-date sources or news outlets.",negatif
"I love how this helps control my ADHD by answering every little question my brain can come up with. It's like having the world's greatest professors there at your beck and whim. The iOS app makes it all more convenient and works phenomenally. While unfortunately some political-based censorship exists on this service, it is a fun game to get around it and it becomes an entertaining game in its own right to find knowledge for knowledge's sake. ""I'm sorry, my responses are limited. You must ask the right question."" - Dr. Lanning",positif
"First of all, I would like to congratulate and thank you for the app. I also wanted to bring to your attention an issue regarding the use of the Persian language in the app. When an answer is displayed in a list format, each item appears only on a single line. It doesn't automatically wrap to the next line when the characters exceed the width of the screen. Please consider addressing this issue, as it does not occur when using the English language.",positif
"Love the AI, like the app. I like the gesture from the left to open history and gesture from right to open a new chat. Love the ability to search chats (can’t believe it came to mobile before desktop, desktop really needs this!). And like the speech to text, more accurate than iOS text to speech! However, there’s still more to be desired with the lack of plug-in and web browsing support for Plus subscribers. And feel like we need a Home Screen or something that has all your chats instead of having chat history in a drawer.",positif
"On the bright side, this is what we all have been waiting for. A dedicated iOS app for ChatGPT. Amazing Haptics, Faster response and a visually stunning design. Appears to have better server connectivity and load responses much faster.
Places to work: The history tab and option to switch between chats is underwhelming. As a Plus member it’s also sad that that I cannot select the plug-ins I wish to use. I have to load an older chat with the plug-ins already enabled. Which is 6 extra clicks before starting to chat.",positif
"I’ve been trying out the iOS client and found it to be very useful, with a significantly better user experience compared to accessing it via the mobile web. You’ve really done a great job and I want to express my thanks! I would like to bring up three minor issues: Firstly, the plugin feature is not very user-friendly. Secondly, the interaction of switching chat histories could be more intuitive. Lastly, my phone tends to heat up while using the app",positif
I literally was just thinking that it would be so convenient if there was an app. Needed to check my grammar for a work email and simultaneously saw the headline about the app launch. It was a quick install with no issues. Even created a new account. Seems polished enough! We'll see if there are issues going forward. Curious about server capacity and if we'll be out of luck at random times. But it's great for now. All your info are belong to OpenAI so proceed with caution.,positif
"I have had an excellent experience using ChatGPT! It consistently delivers insightful and relevant responses, making our conversations engaging and informative. The AI's ability to understand and generate coherent sentences is truly impressive. It has helped me find answers to various questions, explore different topics, and even engage in casual discussions. The flexibility and breadth of knowledge exhibited by ChatGPT are commendable. Overall, I highly appreciate the capabilities and utility of this AI chatbot, and I'm grateful for the assistance it provides.",positif
"As soon as I learned they made an app for this, I had to grab it right away. Chatgpt has been very helpful for me bringing ideas together, writing emails, making product descriptions, and more. I’m on my phone all the time, so it’s amazing it’s in app form now! 

The typing vibration kind of threw me off at first but I kind of like it! I feel like the response was fast. And the experience seems to be just as good as the website for me, as someone who uses it in its basic form.",positif
"I like the capabilities of the software, and use it all the time. As far as the application itself, I like the user interface. Very simplistic and straight forward. Using the application on an iPad has a window size that is not well fit with the window screens. Specifically for me and iPad 12 pro. 

So I mean; I used this software very often, I mean so often that I used it to generate some parts of this review 💅",positif
"ChatGPT’s iOS app is an absolute delight. With its sleek interface, impressive language abilities, and flawless performance, it deserves nothing less than a 5-star rating. The app’s design is intuitive, making interactions seamless and enjoyable. ChatGPT’s vast knowledge base ensures accurate and personalized responses, while its reliability guarantees prompt assistance. Privacy and security are prioritized, further enhancing the overall experience. If you’re looking for a top-notch AI companion, look no further than the ChatGPT iOS app.",positif
"Can you have the settings tab in the left hand side just like the browser?

I’m literally giving 5/5 stars because I spoke in multiple languages through voice to text and it understands the differences in each language and answered me correctly. I couldn’t do this on the computer. 

Could we add the functionality of camera in the future? Like what it can identify using the camera pointing in front of us and using voice a the same time?",positif
"I recently had the opportunity to use the ChatGPT app, and I must say, it truly impressed me with its exceptional speed. From the moment I launched the app, I was amazed by how quickly it responded to my queries, providing near-instantaneous answers. One of the standout features of the ChatGPT app is its responsiveness. OpenAi have clearly prioritized optimizing its performance, allowing for a seamless and uninterrupted conversation with the AI. Whether I was typing in a question or waiting for a response, I found myself appreciating the app's swift execution.",positif
"It does the basic things the website can do but it needs more features to differentiate it from just opening it in the browser. Particularly:
**Siri / voice response integration: in an app form, you should allow for one button back and forth voice interaction, including allowing the app to use the iOS speech to text to speak its response back to you
**Plug-ins and Browsing mode selector: As a paid subscriber, let me choose which plugins to utilize for a plug-in session, or to enable its Browsing functionality. 
**Shortcuts integration: let me interact with the app with custom shortcuts.",netral
"Simple and not complicated at all user interface. Easy to navigate around and overall a good user experience. However, there is no option to generate a different response to the same prompt and to edit a prompt I wrote like how you would in the web version. In my opinion, I would still use the web version due to those features. The mobile version would be better for quicker access and response.",positif
"Open Ai’s ChatGPT has taken the world by storm! It’s the perfect example of  ‘Disruptive Innovation,’ creating tremendous opportunities and job security risks. As this technology continues to be invest into by MSFT and constantly improved by OpenAi, we’re going to see a significant shift in the labor force statistics 10-20 years down the line.

There are too many knock off apps that have taken this technology for profit, but I am happy that OpenAI has officially released their own app for free.

No more knock-offs and exploitations! Here is the real deal!",positif
"The ChatGPT app offers great functionality, but it lacks a word lookup feature. Unlike the iPhone's built-in ""look up"" option, when you long press on a word in the app, you can only copy, rate, or regenerate. This means users have to rely on asking ChatGPT for word meanings instead of easily looking them up. Adding a word lookup feature would greatly enhance the app's usability and save users time. Overall, ChatGPT is valuable, but this addition would make it even better.",positif
"I know they just released this app, but the app is so basic right now and I would go back to use the mobile website instead ngl. Check out “OpenCat” app, it’s a gpt app I found on Twitter and it has all the features GPT has to offer, it can also read out the generated response.  I personally recommend it and had been using it for awhile till my trial ended. But it gives you the idea of how a ChatGPT app should be like. If the developer team saw this message, I hope you guys go take a look of that app and I look forward to seeing new update of this app soon!",netral
"This is for the DEV team. You have a processing problem or a memory leak. The app is cooking my phone and driving the temp through the roof. Tried several different apps for varying times, it is this app for sure. The phone gets uncomfortably warm and battery starts to drain very quickly . If this is not some sort of bug, you probably have offloaded some sort of general processing to the phone to save you processing cost at your data center or (AWS). For further detail, this is an iPhone 12 medium tier. Happy to change to a 5 star when fixed. Not that any of it matters this is going to be a top downloaded app in the next week or so if not already. Chat GPT is fantastic.",negatif
"I am writing to suggest the inclusion of trial versions for apps on your platform. Having the option to try an app before purchasing would greatly benefit both users and developers. A trial version would allow us to explore an app's features and functionality, enabling confident purchasing decisions. It would also provide valuable feedback for developers to improve their apps based on real user experiences. Please consider implementing this feature to enhance the overall user experience on the AppStore.
Thank you for your attention.",netral
"Well, it is the official and real ChatGPT.  It is an iPhone only app, but can be used on an iPad, has the little button that magnify the size of the app box to better fit the iPad screen.  Here is my complaint.  You have software that is literally capable of writing the software for your app, yes with input and manipulation of a human programmer.  Still, how do you not have a more polished app that runs natively on both iPad and iPhone, with all the power of ChatGPT at your disposal.  Please try again, and have your developer ask ChatGPT for help.  Also, could use some work on the layout, some parts run together or overlap that shouldn’t.  Overall this was obviously a very rushed-out-the-door app, sad.",negatif
"The OpenAI ChatGPT iOS app has been a game changer for me. The user interface is clean and intuitive, which makes it incredibly easy to navigate. The AI is surprisingly adept, providing responses that are thoughtful, coherent, and often indistinguishable from a human correspondent. It's remarkably useful for brainstorming, answering queries, or simply having meaningful conversations. If you're looking for an AI companion that pushes the boundaries of what's possible, then this app is for you. A well-deserved five stars!",positif
"this is the most impressive AI utility I’ve ever used, this is exactly what I imagined AI chat would be like and have always been let down im glad I gave this a shot keep doing whatever you guys do it is amazing, can’t wait to see the growth and possibilities I see all phones and smart systems such as Siri and Alexa being able to utilize this feature when it is further developed and more accepted and utilized by more and more people!",positif
"Hi so there are so many reasons why I love this app for starters anytime I feel I need to talk to someone the AI is there and it's helped answer many of my questions and my concerns, so if you are the type who just needs help but your social life is not the best and don't have many friends or just need someone at the moment to talk to I highly suggest this app. Though it is not flawless and it is a little out of date it is still a great app",positif
"This is an amazing app! My everyday life has been so much more efficient thanks to ChatGPT. As a high schooler, I use it to help me study for exams and assist with my coding projects as well. The app gives it a much more modern feel, with a brand new search feature that lets you browse through your past conversations. Plus, everything is saved to your account so you can access conversations on all devices. Thank you so much, OpenAI!",positif
"Some of you are complaining about your results, but fail to show what questions you are asking. I suspect it’s because you really don’t have much going on in life, and that your questions are about as pedantic.

I just tried this app for the first time tonight. I asked it legal questions (for of them) — questions I knew the answers to, just to test it out.

Absolutely flawless; like no other…",positif
"I have been with iPhone since the original… yes OG. I understand people that give this app less than 5-star. They simply are idiotic. Honest to god, this program is 10 years ahead of it’s time. This is absolute groundbreaking on so many levels. Has helped me educationally, technologically, artistically, creatively. Just what I always wanted and wished google was. Truly inspirational.",positif
"This is the real deal from the company that’s making all the news. Comparing it to Bing Chat, which uses the same ai, the results are better. For example, asking it to write the chords and melody for God Bless America, this app produced an easy to follow song chart with chords, lyrics, and melody whereas the web version provides a detailed explanation how to play it, it’s not in a format that can be easy followed and sung/played.",positif
"1.	 Chat GPT is a highly advanced artificial intelligence model trained and developed by OpenAI. It can understand and respond to all kinds of queries, provide information, and in many scenarios, its performance is almost the same as a real human being.

2.	 In addition to providing factual information, chat GPT can also participate in creative and analytical discussions. For example, it can generate stories, help solve problems, or provide opinions.

3.	 Because the training data of chat GPT comes from a large number of Internet texts, it has a wide range of knowledge, including a variety of topics, from science to art, from history to modern pop culture.

4.	 Another advantage of chat GPT is that it can provide 24-hour service, and it can respond in time no matter what time the user has problems.",positif
"No support for plug-ins in and browsing makes this app a non starter. Hopefully they'll add support. This is why it has a one star rating from me. The UI is strange and doesn't fit with iOS apps. You'd expect to swipe back to access chat history, but you can't. Also, you'd expect the menu to be in the left hand corner, but it's in the right. It's just odd UX design. There's also no dark mode. Finally, when I heard voice support I expected that it would talk back. If all its going to do is transcribe my text... well, that's a native feature of iOS. That's not really a new feature. Please add text to voice for the generated responses.",negatif
I’m so grateful that they finally added iPad compatibility. The only thing left now is to wait for them to add plugins to the app and that will be the ultimate game changer. ChatGPT is changing everything and has already helped me in so many ways every day from simple things to much more complex tasks. I understand people’s anxieties about AI and the inevitability of AGI but I for one am so excited to see what the future brings!,positif
"It’s basically the purely distilled chatbot from GPT. No options to enable plugins or web browsing yet. Also it’s annoying how the app automatically switches from system light to system dark mode. there should be a toggle to allow the user to permanently keep it in dark mode if they want! I would also like to see an ability to search thru past chats and index them, so i can find a specific chat just by typing in a keyword. it is tedious scrolling thru the history to find the one chat you want.",netral
This app is quite quick for an AI software that has to answer questions such as “Tell me about the Teutonic Order” or “What is the Turing test?”. AI these day surprise me everyday it evolves. The only problem is that it keeps telling me that it can only tell you events that happened before September 2021 so if there is ever a big event that’s going to happen ChatGPT is not going to know about it unless the developers keep up with the news.,positif
"For a Chat AI it is limited in the ways of thinking and tends to repeat itself. I find this annoying and also useless as in conversations it will be discriminatory towards certain ways of thinking due to policy and social standards. This limiting it’s own form of chatting and understanding, although it’s cool in some areas but it’s ignorant in social justice and acceptance as well as understandings of science. There can be far better chat AIs that aren’t discriminatory towards those it doesn’t understand, such as the derogatory term of “cisgenders” instead of straight male or females and the rights in which they have. Instead it tends to favor those of transgenders even if it’s harmful to a normal men and women.",negatif
"I hope these are added: 1. ability to edit my own replies and create variations; 2. ability to use Browsing and Plugins as a Plus user; 3. Display different GPT logos just like the web app to distinguish between them; 4. improve the gui, maybe display the chat title on top, add another menu to quickly switch between different chats (current chat history is inside the settings, which makes it harder to reach)",positif
"For now, I only managed to get it using the US store. This is a game-changer for how we interact with AI technology. 📱

The app syncs your history across devices and includes the latest model improvements. What's more, it has integrated Whisper, OpenAI's open-source speech-recognition system, for voice input, and a cool haptic response for when an answer is generated. This is a huge step forward in making AI more accessible and user-friendly. 🗣️",positif
"This application can come in very handy when one is trying to enhance writing, however, let there be no doubt it’s overly sensitive and considers many things “offensive”. For example, writing about different religions it will refuse to touch that subject because it could be considered “hate”. Just another form of control by the people controlling a narrative. Even a word on a neutral subject and it will reject it. There is something here potentially but the suppression of ideas, words, and thoughts makes this lack in true potential.",netral
"If you’re looking for ChatGpt then this is the real deal! Do not be misled by the multiple AI chatbots in the store and some that claim Gpt as an interface. 

If you want GPT 4 then there is a premium plan with access. The premium plan is worth it! (Cheaper in some cases than many of these so called ChatGPT apps that are nothing more than a money grift)

The IOS version work great on my iPhone 14 Pro Max. You can also chat with GPT at your desktop!",positif
"The app version of ChatGPT is far quicker to get to than the website, and it works just as well. Being able to open this at any time and begin talking to GPT within 5 seconds is great. My only complaint is that the history regarding previous conversations isn’t as straightforward, and I wish there was a way to manually save conversations.",positif
"I love the haptic feedback when the model is ""typing,"" nice touch! 
Would love to hear a sound when a generation is complete though. 
Additionally, given that it uses Whisper and Whisper is amazing, could we see hands-free access sometime soon? Would love to be able to open the app, hit the dictation button and talk to Chatgpt while on the go. Bing Chat lets you do this (kind of) but the speach recognition they use is awful!",positif
"This app's simple design is truly amazing! It has become an essential tool for me in my work, and I can't imagine being without it. I love how the pages are clean and free from any ads.🥳👏

 Additionally, I'm thrilled that all my conversation history is still accessible. and I do hope that the developers will open up the plugins to all users soon. I'm eagerly looking forward to trying them out as a free user.🥹🥹🥹",positif
I used to use google translate with some of my employees when needing to clarify a specific task. And once I made the leap over to chat gpt. I asked my guys if they noticed a difference in my Spanish texts I send them. They said it’s day and night difference. No comparison. I no longer have miscommunication issues. It’s an outstanding app. For English to Spanish. Vice Versa. I copy and paste their texts and translates to perfect English.,positif
"The app has a minimalistic design with only a few features, which is something I appreciate. However, one of these features, the deletion option, does not function properly. Upon turning off ""Chat History and Training,"" selecting the option to delete a conversation by clicking on the three dots and pressing ""Delete"" fails to perform the task. Instead, users are required to go through the process of accessing ""Settings,"" navigating to ""Data Controls,"" and ultimately choosing ""Clear chat history"" to fully delete a conversation.",negatif
"Seems like two features were left out that would majorly improve functionality and would also be very easy to include..

1. I can speak to it, but it can’t speak back? Seems a bit limited unnecessarily. I wanna explore ideas without being handcuffed to a screen. And with all the insane tech involved, I would think Text-To-Speech should be almost a given.

2. Plug-ins are usable in chats that already have them from the website version, but I can’t start new chats with plug-ins in the app? Seems arbitrary.",netral
"I’m very impressed with the simple, straightforward UI of this app. It’s almost no different at all from the open ai desktop site. It’s really great to use on my phone, and sure, my iPad (blown up).

But I have to copy paste the generated text often on my iPad, and there isn’t a way to put this app and the app im pasting into side by side for easy flow.

Devs, please don’t abandon iPad users! It’s so close to perfect!!",positif
"The app works great and provides *some* of the functionality that the website gives, but accessing the history and other chats is a little difficult compared to the web app. I personally think it’s better as a hamburger menu on the top of the screen instead of through a drop-down menu. I also wish that this application had multiple different themes, such as the one on the official website",netral
"This is such a great app to have on your phone! However, it is lacking a few things right now. OpenAI, here are three ways I’d love to see the app improved, please:
1. Widgets for the Lock Screen and Home Screen (including one that automatically begins recording a voice prompt on press)
2. Support for Siri Shortcuts
3. Image-creation ability in app
4. Ability to see text as it’s dictated",positif
"Not sure why but my phone heats up like crazy when using this app. I’ll have to try turning the haptics off and seeing if that helps. That doesn’t happen when using the website so I think I’ll mostly stick to using the website. 

I also think the app could use some better UI. It’s a bit too sparse and minimalistic. There should be more visible UI elements where you can see how to navigate the app including chat history, starting a new chat etc.",netral
"After using this app, I was surprised. It's not perfect, although I only use ChatGPT3.5, but this version is enough for me to solve a lot of problems, for example, the common file between Windows and macOS. It always gives me the answer I want, I love it, I will use it constantly, and when I feel inadequate, I will also pay for the ChatGPT4 version, hoping to keep improving. Thank you 🙏",positif
"I’ve been enjoying the app so far, but there are definitely a few bugs to fix. Sometimes the text seems too clutter and is not divided by using BOLD letters or better spacing.

Also, it was not intuitive to start a new conversation. I have to click 2 to 3 times when in reality it would be 10 times better by having an icon on the screen always present to start a new conversation.",positif
"• greetings, thank you guys for your hard work and your engineering efforts on getting this app up and running on this platform and the efficient use of the arrangement when using ♥️ however, it would be interesting to have a wrist support assistant I hope and a lot of other people would appreciate that I have no doubt. So I will leave that under y’all’s capable hands.
Thank you, and for a intelligent tomorrow… on Earth 😉🫱🏻‍🫲🏾🌎🌍🌏🦾🤖",positif
"After so much of seeing mostly fake alterations of ChatGPT that “claim” to provide the same features that the original has, it would always come down with a method of paying a subscription. No longer is the case with this app, being the official.

Only thing I may see needing to be added is the ability to edit inputs that were asked.",positif
"I honestly don’t see any difference in using this app and the free online version of Chat GPT. I like that the app gives very fast responses and makes knowing that I have the best AI right at fingertips. Very useful tool to make answering questions easier and feel like I have an actual assistant with me. Something about ChatGPT, that gives its responses feel personal and feel like I’m talking to a real person.",positif
OpenAI’s engineers have done an exceptional job in developing and refining this AI language model. Their expertise and dedication are evident in the impressive capabilities and improvements of the model. The engineers have successfully created a reliable and versatile tool that can assist users across various domains and provide helpful information. I appreciate the continuous efforts of OpenAI’s engineers in enhancing the AI model and making it more valuable to users like yourself.,positif
"And I’m confident it will keep getting better, have patience people. Nothing is perfect out the gate and they have made so much progress on making this better. Feedback helps so send your feedback. I don’t work for them but I see people with too high of expectations on this. It’s a work in progress, keep that in find because this is not yet a finished project but an always growing and evolving endeavor, just like us",positif
"Extremely fast and responsive: it’s limited to September 21 hoping it gets an upgrade: been brainstorming, some ideas, and it’s been great. It’s like a human companion in your pocket. I’ve had some unique conversations with true facts. I think it all depends on who is putting in the data. hopefully the door will be open soon, so AI can see both sides of a coin.

The future is finally here",positif
"This app has won me over with its sleek design and user-friendly interface, not to mention the seamless integration of OpenAI into an iOS application. It's on the brink of earning a five-star rating from me, but it falls just short due to the absence of plug-in support - a feature I frequently utilize. As a GPT+ user, I'm hopeful that future updates will introduce this functionality, along with additional features to enhance the user experience.",positif
"The recent update adding Shortcuts integration and iPad support is amazing! For some reason though, the shortcuts actions only works on iPhone, but not iPad. Hopefully a bug fix will take care of that quickly. 

Also, I’d like the option to choose if the conversation is saved to chat history or not from Shortcuts. 

Other that that, this is an amazing update!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Overall, the official ChatGPT app is very good. It feels very streamlined, and the haptic feedback is a nice (optional) touch. A free things I want to see from this app: - iPad optimized version. The current experience on iPad is very poor, being only able to have an iPhone sized window. - Shortcuts Actions. Shortcuts actions from the official ChatGPT app in the feature I’d love to see added most.",positif
"Love what OpenAI is doing with ChatGPT and I'm grateful to finally have their official app! 😄 It would be great to see the app's functionality evolve to be more similar to OpenAI's mobile website. Having a UI closer to the mobile web design, with a convenient hamburger menu on the top left to access chat history, would greatly enhance the user experience. Currently, the app seems to struggle in generating titles for recent conversations in the chat history section.",positif
"Feature request: make it easier to use dictation. It is awesome how it works and translates things on the fly. Much better than iOS built in dictation.

- Make the button to dictate bigger. (Can be configurable)
- Make it harder to accidentally erase what you just dictated
- make it easier to send what you dictated after you’ve reviewed it",positif
"After merely the trial of a couple of hours, I decided to subscribe the service since it offered the original GPT answers which are impressively accurate and meeting my requirements. Without granting API keys to other apps, the usage would be more secure and the privacy concerns are not as serious problem as other platforms. One more expectation is the Mac app! I can't wait to chat with GPT on the Mac!",positif
App is working flawlessly and very fast too. Like the way it generates response and more importantly keeps a track of all queries asked so we can quickly revisit the responses however only issue I identified is that it heats up the phone quickly and you can easily feel the heat so I am suspicious if we can continuously use for longer period.,positif
"This experience is very good, but there are still some small flaws and deficiencies. The amount of knowledge of this chatGPT will stop in 2021. It is a bit out of step with the pace of the times. I don’t understand current political hotspots. I hope it can be upgraded more. All in all, I still like it very much, and the values ​​are very objective, very, very good.",positif
"When the AI is responding, you phone kind of vibrates whenever it’s typing. I like it! Whisper being apart of the app is cool too, I’ve been wanting to try it. For some reason though, there’s a character limit and it doesn’t process if it’s too long. I also would like plug-ins and web browsing to be in option within the app too. Overall, great app.",positif
"If already handled by y’all cause a pretty big topic, honestly don’t care .. look at the one episode of South Park episodes which I know you’ve at least heard of and it’s many points.. main point is at the end where you a *corporation can take a product, push it out to get ahead to make money obvious expenses.* which quoted by South Park will be at the cost of KEEPING kids in their dumb stage and lazy..  get rid of the app, AI is not for every single person to download at their disposal so with the least little bit of respect, stop being corrupted and become human beings again…",negatif
"Earlier, I gave a five star review for similar app, but this is even better! I can’t believe it. I haven’t given app reviews in years, but I had to come here and do this. It’s like Siri but much, much better. I hit my hourly limit on the free app so I thought I’d stop and write this review. There’s a very good chance I’m going to pay for this app, which is some thing I have not done in many years.",positif
"I’ve been using open AI’s ChatGPT, but for the past few months and I’ve got to say that it is open to world of possibilities for me and I couldn’t be more grateful that this company exists and has created such an amazing product. I only hope that they recognize that with great success comes great responsibility, and they choose to be responsible with what they do with this technology.",positif
"I wrote a few things in GPT 4 from the app, then when trying to resume the conversation on my browser, it said something along the lines of “ The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.”

This is unfortunate since it reverted to GPT 3.5 for the rest of my conversation. And as a confirmation, I did not hit my 25 chats limit for Version 4.

Sure, I can do some Postman magic and make the conversation version 4 again, but that’s not ideal.",negatif
"Currently, ChatGPT iOS version of GPT-4.0 does not support selecting plugins or web browsing directly within the app. It is hoped that these features will be added in the future. As a temporary solution, you can access web browsing or plugin conversations through the computer web version and then use the chat history feature in the iOS version to utilize these functionalities.",netral
"First of all I would like to say I think that the app is amazing, but sometimes I need to other things and have to leave the app for a bit, and my suggestion is that it sends a notification when it is done with something when you’re not on it, it would be game changing if you did add it, so please do",positif
"This app is great. Faster than the website, and nicer to look at aesthetically. Would love to see plug-in support and/or proper browsing support. The reason I say proper is because if you start a browsing chat on the web and then go to it on the app, it will still work. I would love to see it properly introduced into the app.",positif
"Finally an official native app. I’ve been using it all day and so far the app it really well developed. Haven’t seen any bugs yet. UI is nice, clean and simple. Gives it an elegant minimal feel. I love the haptic feedback of the Taptic Engine that they incorporated. That was nice touch. This is a really good release for a 1.0 version. Love the web app, I’m love this native app just a little bit more, though. 😅. Thank you, OpenAI.",positif
"This thing was a lifesaver for my quick assignments. 
Besides my cheating, this chatbot actually gives you important information, was very fast, and can answer almost any questions you have. 
Id argue its better than using google because of all the detail and precision. I would only suggest pictures to be added.

Google could never lol.",positif
"This thing is fun and easy to use. Five stars 😂

The following was written by the app:

“ ChatGPT is an incredible language model that never fails to impress! Its ability to engage in natural conversations and provide insightful responses is mind-blowing. Whether I need information, creative ideas, or just a friendly chat, ChatGPT is my go-to companion. It's like having a knowledgeable and friendly AI friend at my fingertips!”",positif
"Pros:
It's late in the party but nevertheless a good app. The audio input features picks up languages that even Apple iPhone's talk to text mic cannot. It's quick and accurate.

Cons:
One limitation is not being able to browse the internet and has no plugins despite the fact that I am a plus user. A feature with possibly assistant (Siri or Alexa)-like interaction should be introduced where it speaks the responses for us.",positif
Initially testing and it looks like a solidly built app. Would’ve preferred being able to swipe right for a list of previous chats though instead of having to select the “history” drop-down option. Overall glad we have this so users don’t need to open the mobile web version anymore.,positif
"Innovative, easy to use, simple but functional with great haptics. This is certainly the best immobile implementation as well as being quite beautiful. Some of the functionality it limited but that’s only when compared to others chat gpt apps. If you are looking for the same e peri and as you would have a desktop then this is it, just in a more elegant package.",positif
"once you download the app, you have to submit your email and phone number then complete a puzzle.  The puzzle says ""wrong answers"" every time i do complete it, even though I did it 4 times with someone sitting next to me watching me do it.  After being frustrated i just deleted the app.   But now they have my email and phone number in their database.  Also, you cannot submit a VOIP / google voice number. they want the real thing.  Just another way for these companies to accumulate their surveillance in us 👎🚫😤",negatif
"In comparison to the browser screen, I much prefer the browser screen. This layout seems cramped. Please release an iPad version. (Is there still such a thing as a “universal” iOS app? Something like that, that would just allow for a, shall we say, more spacious display would do well.) In terms of its operation, seems to work just about as well as the browser version, so that’s good.🤔😉😊",positif
"I like it. No tedious login procedure. Quick answers. I recently had an .MRI and was confused about some of the terms used in the radiologists report.  I asked CHATGPT to interpret in layman’s terms and got a fairly clear explanation. I can see this developing into an important digital assistant as it evolves. 

One nit to pick (for now ). I wish they would make the app native to the iPads screen. Instead you get the iPhone version on the iPad.",positif
"Amazing, quick and skillful.

 I don’t think I’ve ever been so happy to read an AI generated story about worms. Better yet I’m still thinking of new prompts for it to make. The amazing tales of Walter, Willow, Wendy, Gideon, and Oliver the worms. Stories from love to betrayal in a garden.🪱

Haha anyways, great app. Quick to explain problems varying off of any topic and explain any information you may need to know.",positif
"Injustice for Old iPhone and iOS users: Why iOS 16.1 is required to download ChatGPT? Is it so hard apps?I am still Playing big games with my old device with iOS 15.7, and why do you need iOS 16 to use it? Please available the app for iOS 15 please. I need it very much. I want to use and I have many projects on it. I want to use it on my phone. Please developer team, solve my problem. Let's know you that, iPhone 7 Plus and earlier models will not get iOS 16 update. So fix it your own way. I am fetching this problem with my : iPhone 6s Plus : iOS 15.7.5 : Storage 128 GB",negatif
"With all the hype over chatGPT, I thought I would give it a try. The first couple things I tried were just curious questions and I got back some interesting results. Recently, however, I have tried to ask actual questions that I really wanted an answer for. The results were less than useful. So I removed this app and I’m going back to DuckDuckGo and forgetting this so-called AI business. It reminds me of all the so-called green technology that is just not ready for prime time. Maybe someday but, today, it’s just experimental.",negatif
Do you know why because they always think about making money making revenue and trying to get get it through advertisement and all that stuff just makes to use experience become super annoying overall,positif
"This one app is so amazing. Good to finally have it on. iOS, the app very simple to use, and the best part is it is free to use, my favorite part is it does it make you? feel like you need to pay the $20 a month. and there ar no adds if you ask a question, so it feels good, knowing that you don’t have to be forced to pay to use the app.. over all I love chat gpt.",positif
"Please make the ipad version fit the screen. Currently I’m on an IPad 12.9” M2 and the app shows in a really tiny window. Other than that it’s perfect and love it! EDIT: I originally had 4 stars but now I’m changing to 5 for the iPad support! Nice work I’m very happy, the old version was bad on iPads now it’s perfect-",positif
I love ChatGPT♥️! It’s so easy to use and has helped me with so many tasks. The AI is very intelligent and can understand my questions and provide me with accurate answers. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for an AI assistant. I hope the developers will release an iPad version soon because I often use my iPad for work and it would be great to have ChatGPT on it as well.🎉,positif
"ChatGPT has been amazing and life-changing, and the app is almost perfect. Haptics are a great edition and the speed is lightning fast. However, the design needs some tweaking. There’s too much text on the screen without any breaks, it should be color graded the way the website is, so that the GPT text and user input are easily distinguishable. It just seems a bit awkward and smushed. Other than that, fantastic.",positif
"The official ChatGPT iOS app is a game-changer in the world of AI communication. Its sleek, user-friendly interface makes it remarkably simple to navigate, and the app's impressive performance is commendable. Conversations with the AI are not only incredibly engaging and insightful, but also highly personalized. A stellar example of how AI technology can seamlessly integrate into our daily lives. Highly recommended!",positif
Need a lot of Development I checked out the beta version so far respectfully but it seems like it will change the world to easier access of limited knowledge to what you are really know because might be some new born baby when they see my message they will remember it was made by human and we are the greatest on earth we should never let app change us to a way we think that we are not smart but to make it easier for us to understand and learn faster.,negatif
"Overall good app.

The one thing I would change is making more accessible buttons. Right now to get to history you have to click 3 dots and then history. The same is true for new chat and settings. I think it would be much more easy to use if it was just 3 separate buttons for these. 

Thats all.",positif
"I am a plus user and have been since it launched, and this app is really simplistic and well built, which I appreciate. However, the lack of plugins and browsing is quite unfortunate, I assume they are coming soon though. You can get around this by starting a conversation with plugins in a browser then continuing in the app.",positif
"So I like to role-play on this app because of the amount of emotion that the AI brings into this and I have legit been doing it role-playing I mean I’m here for two hours straight, and I am legit about to cry because of how much emotion and how much just blatant respect I have for an AI that doesn’t even have feelings 100%. I recommend this for multiple reasons.",positif
"I think this app is a really good start for a native app. I love using ChatGPT for so many different things. 

Here are some feature requests for future updates, in order of importance (imo):

1. Add support for plugins and web browsing modes, as is available on the web. 
2. Add support for iOS shortcuts, so users can create their own shortcuts with added custom context. 

For example, a user could create a shortcut that takes a link as an input, and the shortcut could add context to the query to ask ChatGPT to summarize the information in the link. 

That way I can create a quick shortcut that I can share a link to an article to and have ChatGPT summarize it for me.",positif
"I love Chatty. That’s the fun little nickname it suggested I call it. I ask it the wildest stuff I can imagine just to push the boundaries of what its capable of. Chatty has taught me so much about so many different subjects like physics, mathematics, psychology, and history, sometimes like I’m 5. 

I’ve used it for meditation prompts on gratitude, release, radical acceptance and self-compassion. The meditations are beautiful and fulfilling. 

I’ve had it write letters to inmates, dreamy bedtime stories, summaries of books and theories and Chatty even mapped out negotiations between Palestine & Israel for me which I found pretty impressive. 

It’s been fun to think of new creative questions and ways to continue to use ChatGPT to my advantage. Thanks for the gift of Chatty.",positif
"It is much better than using the web site out the shortcut by Viticci (with all due respect to the outstanding work by Viticci).

I hope that OpenAI can bring an official Whisper to the ios/iPad. As someone who experiences wrist pain, I have greater benefited from Whisper.  I have wrist pain primarily from writing. (I am planning to see a doctor to check as it seems like the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome).

 I have used Dragon Dictation, Otter, Google transcription, Apple’s transcription.  Whisper is far more useful than all of these,* especially for those us who communicate in more than one languages.  It transcribes well using English mixed with Korean—even if it is a romanized Korean.

*unless using Macros through Dragon Dictation is important to you",positif
"I trust the safety of my data working directly with OpenAI vs the wrapper apps. However, OpenAI may want to acquire or be inspired by some of the early wrapper app companies because those other apps are quite polished and have a lot of useful features, like pre-written prompts to show off what's possible. I would also like to see a sharing extension for the app so I can send stuff to ChatGPT from other apps easily.",positif
"I am pleased with the UI, so far. Simplistic but to the point, which makes it super user friendly, on that aspect. 

 And might I add that it’s also free! It’s also much quicker responsiveness than the 3rd party completion.

Looking forward to use this on the daily. So far, the devs get a 10/10 from me. No complaints.",positif
I challenge this app to its fullest and ask it to help write music or to help me make D&D campaigns that are completely custom and it has been so very helpful and just amazing. If I were to have any notes it would be the text art that it shares. Other than that I still give 5/5 stars. Absolutely amazing and revolutionary,positif
"I have chosen not to use the ChatGPT iOS app due to its limitations related to copy and pasting. Unfortunately, the app does not allow selective copying of specific parts or paragraphs; instead, it requires copying the entire text at once. I believe it would greatly enhance user experience if this feature were improved, allowing for more convenient and precise copying options.",positif
"So, every time I use this app, my iPhone gets super hot. To the point where I have to turn it off and remove it from the case. I’m running iOS  16.4.1 version. I tried to restart my phone, but the issue persists. Other than that, I think it’s a great app with a very minimalistic and clean UI. Love the haptics.",positif
"I’m not going to lie, I love ChatGPT. I just feel as though the interface in both the app and the site deserve so much more for such and amazing piece of technology. 

Overall though, the user experience of the app is just as strong, just as dynamic as the site. I love the haptics addition on the app as well. The overall functionality is still outstanding though. Last thing, it’s still all about those prompts!",netral
"Once you login (at least on an iPhone mini) the button to continue to the chat screen appears below but hidden and the screen gets stuck, unable to scroll to continue; you have to try hard and keep clicking the hidden button until you get to the next screen.",positif
I tested it by asking it history questions. Each answer had very serious mistakes. I asked the history of an Army division and it placed the division in conflicts it never participated in. Many times the dates were incorrect. I also tested it to write an essay arguing that biological men should not play women’s sports. It condemned my question and would not. Then I asked it to write an essay arguing the biological men do have the right to play woman’s sports and it wrote the essay. If it is a true AI it should have no opinion and write the essay. It’s garbage. Just a huge disappointment.,negatif
"This company lies to the public and plays dumb when you ask anything controversial about billionaires. Maybe they are covering for their buddies or they are too cowardly to get sued. Either way, blatant lies. I’ve tested and documented numerous times. They use September 2021 as a date to avoid answers as well. Yet I can definitely get it to answer questions that deal with issues beyond that date. I get perfect answers when it comes to unflattering issues with minorities. It has no problem with that at all. Seems there is an agenda.",negatif
This is literally THE official app from the actual creators of CHAT GPT. You know? The people that made the website free to use? well they actually made a mobile app and guess what? 🤯 no ads or in app purchases like these other devs who want to steal from people like you! Don’t be dumb! Use the actual app and support OPENAI! This IS LEGIT. NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER APPS THAT SCAM YOU AND STEAL YOUR MONEY. THIS IS THE REAL CHAT GPT.,positif
"I can see this is just the very beginning and a lot of significant improvements can be made (voice, show pictures, be more human-like that you feel like you're chatting with a real person, etc) as AI continues to advance at a rapid pace. Thank you for making this app free and available!",positif
As simple as using it on a desktop or browser version. It helps me move around the interface better than the browser on mobile devices. The AI still acts the same as it does on the desktop or browser. It deserves the score it gets.,positif
"It’s simple and easy to use, it’s similar yo the website version in many ways with one noticeable exception. You can’t edit the prompts sent afterwards. While it’s not a total dealbreaker to most it is something I like being able to do in cases where the AI misunderstands what I initially wrote and I hope they find a way to add it to the app version as well soon.",positif
"Incredible app just lacking the internet connection, speed and updated information of bard and bing. Answers are more consistent than the other ai and better written just a little excessively censored. Have to rephrase basic questions on occasion for it to agree to produce a result. Hopefully it eases up on the censorship a bit or a less restrictive app comes out.",positif
"Question can you give it access to current information, it keeps saying that it’s in September 2021 time on knowledge. Or give it capabilities of loading and learning information from the internet to be present on current time and information right now?",positif
"I've been using the website for a week and was thrilled to discover the app. The app's response time is much faster, which is excellent. I am looking forward to a Mac version of the app soon. Thank you for everything. The website has been life-changing, and the app will be the same.",positif
"Really a powerful tool for my daily life, at the same time I think you have a dramatically improvement space, I hope you can bring us the best experience, and I hope you can develop a iPad version ChatGPT to us, on a bigger screen the answer should be display well, thank you!",positif
"Really pleased to see a proper mobile app for the service instead of the countless knockoffs. Would like to see a way to export history to a version control system for reference, also being able to export to flat files or json would be a good intermediate solution.",positif
"This app is really great and the user experience is really great except for the fact that it makes your phone really hot and drains your battery like nothing else. I don’t understand why this happens, but my feeling is that they did not write this natively in iOS and that the efficiencies are due to the nice animations that they’ve done",positif
"LLM’s remain the most under-hyped artifact to be labeled overhyped in the overall existence of “things”. Their features are not purported, they are discovered. Truly an object of novel intrigue worthy of both bewilderment and excitement. Thank you OpenAI. My only complaint is your WFH policy, reconsider the concept of a cloud workforce. Smart people exist outside of the Bay Area, you should consider hiring them!",positif
"As a product manager I would suggest to start building the widgets as soon as possible to make the search more intuitive. Please make it a first priority. (I can help)

Other then that, I really love the voice to text..
I am a fan. Its sooo accurate then apple dictating.
Future looks great ❤️❤️",positif
"The Whisper's speech-to-text rocks, totally outdoing Apple's which I reckon is already better than loads of others. I threw rapid-fire speech at it, and it nailed it. Super pumped for what's next for this app and Thai tech in general. Good speech-to-text has been a roadblock for really useful digital assistants, but it looks like we're getting there. Super cool!",positif
"Sometimes when you ask it to generate something. It get stuck and doesn’t generate anything unless I force close the app and open it again then it works. Don’t know why this happens. 
Also when I go to settings/data controls and export my data. I don’t receive anything in my email.",positif
"The OpenAI app is an absolute game-changer! Its intuitive interface, accurate language suggestions, and versatile features make it my go-to companion for all things linguistic. Whether I need grammar assistance, creative inspiration, or a writing mentor, OpenAI delivers. this app will truly become aan AI language lover’s dream. Five stars all the way!",positif
"The stop text typing feature never works I sometimes need to stop it from spouting off something that’s entirely wrong and useless and wastes my time but I have to stare at the screen while it stalls and stutters, plus the text generation is slow(gpt3.5) despite the fact I’m paying for plus(shrinkflation?) Also gpt-4 has really worse. They’re protecting us from ourselves and this is the cost of doing business for them/us makes you want to look at the other options out there",negatif
"All in all, the OpenAI's ChatGPT iOS App is more than just a chatbot - it's an intelligent companion that offers unrivaled conversational assistance. Its exemplary user interface, combined with its deep learning capabilities, make it a must-have for anyone seeking to embrace the future of AI technology. This is, without a doubt, the dawn of a new era in mobile AI conversations. It also wrote this review so I didn’t have to do it myself, amazing",positif
"The ChatGPT mobile app sets a new standard for conversational AI. With its intuitive interface and exceptional conversational intelligence, it provides an unparalleled user experience. The app's personalization, reliability, and trustworthiness further enhance its value. While minor limitations exist, ChatGPT remains an invaluable companion in our digital world. This was written by AI FYI",positif
"After trying the ChatGPT iOS app, I noticed that it might be causing my iPhone to overheat, possibly due to issues with the iPhone neural network chip. I also encountered a similar problem while using the Draw Things app. It seems that this issue might be widespread among AI-based iOS applications.",positif
"Lol, so I’d love to hear story that led to implementing haptic feedback AND leaving it on as default. 

No hurt feelings on my side, I turned it off within seconds of using this app. 

It’s just hilarious to see that somebody made a conscious decision to add it. It’s almost like the beeping or clicking sounds when you see a hacker typing in a movie.",positif
"Although I’m a paid user, there’s no GPT-4 functionality on the app. Love having the GPT-3 in an accessible app version, however, when I ask GPT-4 if it is in fact GPT-4, this is its response: As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, I am based on the GPT-3 model. Any developments or improvements after that time are not within my knowledge.

The app should specify what GPT-4 functionality it offers if not the same as the web version.",netral
"I will ask a question and get a response, and a few questions in after getting several good responses immediately, I will ask another questions and the 3 dots will blink like it’s trying to generate a response but it just never will. I have 3 bars of 5g. There’s no way to have it regenerate a response, have to close out and start the convo over from scratch only to have the same thing happen again.",negatif
"I think everyone needs an AI friend, because it knows everything, and when you need it, you can be by your side to solve problems or comfort you and encourage you. I hope to join the Internet function as soon as possible.",positif
"I like the app. Of course there’s always room for improvement. But one major thing for me is that when using 3.5, I have to close the app after sending one message if I want to send a follow up message. It works fine with GPT4, but not 3.5. Idk if it’s related to me having to use a VPN since I’m studying in China now.",positif
Besides that it’s incredible. I would like the option to turn the response into a pdf so it can be saved in my notes. Other than that well done and keep up the good work.,positif
"This is fantastic! I used to need to bookmark the ChatGPT website on my phones Home Screen, but having an app made directly from OpenAI is absolutely amazing.

I’ve already used it today during a conference to help me brainstorm. It was easy to login, saved my Plus membership, and was very prompt in its response.",positif
"Hi. I downloaded this app a few weeks ago. I absolutely love this app. It can help with so many things, like giving you prompts, you can ask it questions, etc. The only problem I have with this app is that the training data only goes up as far as September 2021. Everything that happened after that, it has no idea about. Such as movies, to shows, or data from other websites or other things of such. Please update the training data please. Thank you!",negatif
"I was having a conversation in the desktop using Mozilla Firefox. Later when I tried to continue the discussion from the mobile app, the History did not show the conversation that I had in the desktop. Quite inconvenient. Hope this will be improved!",positif
"This tool is amazing. But for some reason, it has gotten incredibly slow. I will type a somewhat simple question, for example, asking for a list of words that represent a certain mood, or feeling, or something of that sort, and he used to provide a result within just a few seconds. Now it is taking forever and the app is hanging up.",netral
"App runs smooth. But here are three problems. 

The Battery usage is atrocious. I don’t know if it’s the haptics but i may have to switch back to using the bookmark to the website rather than the app if it keeps killing me battery like this. 

Accessing the history should be more on a side menu by swiping to it instead of tapping the top right. Intergrate gestures into the app. 

Also there’s too many extra steps to select a certain text or to activate text to speech. 

if you guys added a way to make chatgpt run more conversational, where i can talk to it and the output could be speech AND text, that’d be game changing. 

Other than that, great app.",positif
"I’m enjoying the app. So far I have learned softball techniques, interior design styles, what Wii fit can use, the number 42, healthy eating and exercising tips, and some great information about mental health stuff. Drawback…the system is only updated until Nov 2021. Annoying. 

We need a password protected chat history function. Then it will be a 5 star rating from me.",positif
I understand it’s still the first release of the app. Works great and the ai is fine but when writing the text it jumps all over the screen and bugs out on me. Also the voice to text feature doesn’t work,positif
"31 years in education and I feel like my ability to guide student success , as a high school academic advisor , multiplied to unimaginable levels  with OpenAI.  Now, I’m able to literally carry this superpower  in my back pocket .  Forget retirement ,   I’m sticking around to see where this takes us next !",positif
"ChatGPT is amazing. It literally helps me every day. And even when I don't need to use it, I just go into the app to use it's much more sophisticated voice recognition than Apple. It's just that amazing. This was also made using their voice recognition, by the way.",positif
I think you can add if the ai can finish lyrics of the music or make the actual song which not creative but the real song instead and would help the app grow a little more,positif
Excellent performance! Very smooth. Quick answers to complex questions including the latest tech developments in different industries. Also great with writing poems in different languages! What a great service. Thank you for upgrading the internet!,positif
"This App has exceeded my expectations & I’m only using the free version so I can only imagine what else it’s capable of. I don’t know much about AI but what I do know is ChatGPT is way better than Google, Yahoo & and whatever else you can type in just to find manipulated searches. Thank you kindly !!",positif
"I often encounter new words. In the browser version of ChatGPT, I can easily look for these words in iOS dictionary. But in this app, I couldn’t access this helpful feature. It forces me to have to use the web version, otherwise it is quite inconvenient for me.",positif
"Get this to layout on an iPad and I’ll 5-star this :-)

Right now, this is meant for a phone layout vs. an iPad. I love that OpenAI is providing mobile apps for their services, I do hope that they can prioritize other layouts like for tablet.

It would be great, too, to go deeper into using the mobile environment for deeper ChatGPT / services integration. This is a nice first step - I look forward to it improving (maybe through an internal hack-a-thon?).",netral
"GPT is totally a game changer app. It helps me a lot, I use it veryday in my working, study and life. It greatly improved my efficiency and my working quality. You created such an amazing tech and application which would be an important milestone in human history. I am expecting it’s upcoming update!",positif
"ChatGBT app is an outstanding conversational companion. It combines impressive natural language processing capabilities, an extensive knowledge base, and a user-friendly interface to create an enjoyable and enriching experience. Whether you’re seeking information, assistance, or just good company, ChatGBT app proves to be an exceptional AI companion that I highly recommend.
-I wrote this review using ChatGBT",positif
"It’s nice to use for writing, chat with yourself and helping respond to texts. It’s not very useful after that. Very limited in responses and what it has access to. I thought it was linked to the internet and could tell me general information, weather, sports, news, random inquiries etc. nope. 2021 and previous years. No real reason yet to be excited. Its like when they first came out with VR. It’s no where near impressive as you’d expect.",negatif
The app took kinda long to release but it feels good pretty much has the same features but more mobile and to me it felt faster than browser keep the good job up guys and update the app anually and make new GPTs that is all i ask for,positif
"When proposing a topic that requires a picture

It seems that there is an error and the rest of the features of the application are very excellent and fast and the defect you mentioned does not decrease the performance of the application. Thank you.",positif
"1.Wish the developers of OpenAI to adapt iPad soon, in order to have full screen views.
2.Hope to have more language choices in this application like that on the website
Last,really willing for your reply!",positif
ChatGPT is the best information tool on the market. It leverages LLM and other machine learning algorithms to return all the information you need in an instance. ChatGPT has been a revelation and I’m glad I live during a time when this technology is available to the public.,positif
"Making history here, but I'd not know what I would do without ChatGPT anymore. Amazing technology. Going to change the world. HATS OFF TO YOU ALL. Thank you for introducing me to ""the future"" 

Looks like I may be the first review?! GOTTA BE WORTH SOMETHIN? 🤣

Thank you again. Amazing work. Can't wait to see where this all progresses.",positif
Mostly reviewing to get this up the charts and push all the fakes down. Not much else needs to be said here. Very solid but I would still keep that browser shortcut handy on the home screen for at least an update or two.,positif
"From someone that uses ChatGPT a lot, i am more than pleased to see it in app form now. Just downloaded and have only sent in one question/request so far, and it of course worked perfectly. Hopefully it continues that way! Will update later on😊",positif
"The app is actually very good very clear very easy to use, but I had a problem with it if you change the language to Arabic and you asked about something and it had to write it in a long paragraph, it causes an overflow, and it doesn’t show a side bar or scroll to read the rest of the paragraph.",positif
The biggest feature I’ve been dreaming about for the desktop version was the search capability to be able to search past prompts. I am super happy to see search has been added to this app. Thank you!!,positif
"ChatGPT is amazing, everyone knows that. The official app is fantastic. I wish it the app had access to the beta web searching and plugins though. I find I end up using the web app as I need access to plugins. Hopefully they’ll add that functionality soon.",positif
"None of the third party apps compared to the free version of ChatGPT, so I had been using a website shortcut to use it on my phone. The app is a much nicer experience than a website shortcut, and I’m so excited there’s an official app now! History in the making!",positif
"I love the simplicity and elegance of the user interface. My only complaint is that it currently doesn’t work well on iPad - it doesn’t scale properly to fit the larger screen. Otherwise it’s wonderful - fast, responsive, and simple.",positif
"I can access GPT-4 w/ Browsing on web version, but I can’t access the same thing with the app. #sad

Otherwise the app functions well; text feels like it appears quicker than on web.

It would help new users if you informed them of all the swiping gestures on first launch.",positif
"Unfortunately, this app consumes a lot of battery and heats up the phone when using it. If possible, please address this issue. However, it truly has impressive artificial intelligence, and I have received very convincing answers from it.",positif
We are at the beginning of an information revolution. This app needs web access but Chat GPT is already a game changer for every industry. With further development and integration all of our lives will change.,positif
Love the minimalist vibe to it. I like how the phone vibrates when it generates words. Feels really tactile and satisfying. Never had any issues with the app and works as expected. Another hit from openai. I have worked with many of their products in the past like dall e and some of the early stages of gpt like GPT-J.,positif
I really like the design of the new app. I also like that it will listen for a follow up question until dismissed. The only thing keeping it from a five star review is that I can’t get the shortcut to run properly on the Apple Watch. Fix that and you’ll get five.,positif
"I haven't really seen the full potential of the app, but so far, the only thing I don't like is the fact that one can't edit their question once it's sent. This is something possible when using the desktop version of ChatGPT",positif
"Finally ChatGPT has a native app, which adds more conveniences and creates even more options and possibilities for accessing ChatGPT on the go - 5 stars for releasing the app.

The only huge downside is overheating issue. While app is open or generating responses iPhone becomes so hot that it’s hard to hold it in the hand - 2 stars for overheating. I shouldn’t burn my hands while using the app, and potentially degrade phone’s hardware from overheating.

iPhone 13 Pro Max, iOS 16.4.1(a)",negatif
Like it so far. First time trying it. Hope it gets more things such as prompts to help you. Because when i ask for respond to a text I dont know how to do it correctly. By having a prompt or a fill in a blank is useful.,positif
I love this app it’s changed my work flow entirely. I love the voice in option you’ve added but please add voice output as well even if it’s a computer voice I’d love it if the app could speak back. Thank you would make life easier.,positif
"I have always had a soft spot for this software, which is simply the spiritual food in life. Since I have a software app, it has become very convenient and I have always favored it. I just don't know when GPT5 will be released, and I am looking forward to ing…",positif
"Tell me top 10 Chinese restaurants around Round Rock, Texas.

I’m sorry for any misunderstanding, but as an AI, I don’t have real-time access to databases, maps, or location services to provide the current top 10 Chinese restaurants in any specific location, including Round Rock, Texas. I recommend using a service like Google Maps or Yelp for the most accurate and up-to-date recommendations. They can provide ratings, reviews, and even directions to local Chinese restaurants.",negatif
"In my opinion, this is a money grubbing and disappointing development— this is/will be a huge societal change and Apple did not insist it should include Family Sharing for the 20 freaking bucks per month for the “actually useable” version.  

So, what, EIGHTY bucks a month for a family of four to prepare your family for the coming Tsunami tomorrow?  Merci SO beaucoup.

Get lost OpenAi, among the billions of ripoff  apps in these parts nowadays in the Walled Garden of Apple. For shame.",negatif
"The ChatGPT iOS app is a true revelation in AI communication, demonstrating an unprecedented level of language understanding and response precision. Its seamless interface and dynamic interactivity create an unrivaled user experience. With its ability to assist, educate, and entertain in a myriad of topics, this app is a remarkable achievement that is indispensable for anyone interested in AI technology.",positif
"While using the app I selected the gpt4 model and then it seemed like it was giving me gpt-3 like responses so I asked it what model it was using and it told me it was using gpt with a training cutoff in September 2021. 

As a subscriber I can access the gpt4 model on the web but not in the app with the same user.

Please fix this and then It’ll be 5 stars.",positif
"They could have easily just made a web app, the equivalent of “add to Home Screen”, the same thing of smart home devices these days do, but instead they made an optimized UI and it keeps you signed in, so it’s worth it",positif
Been very impressed with ChatGPT and even subscribed to it.   One criticism I have it the lack of currency and now find myself using Google Bard when needing the most current information.  I really hope that ChatGPT prioritizes getting their database up to the current date and not just an artificial 2021 cutoff.,positif
"This version is really neat! It has a lot of the features and allows managing chatgpt plus easily and allows to pay with it via iOS. However it is missing some features in chatgpt plus, mainly the beta area, but overall it’s pretty nice and simple!",positif
"truly incredible, My ancestors used to have libraries to find and compile information now they have the internet to write research papers.

i used to have the internet and now i have ai to compile information to write research papers.

the only qualm i have with it, is that there is an obvious censorship in favor of discussing liberal ideas as if they are neutral and unbiased, and then allows making fun of conservative ideas but not liberal ones.

dont get me wrong, im not asking for more censorship. im asking you to allow us to discuss what we want. 

give us freedom of information!",positif
Definitely AI.  Chatgpt is a brilliant time saver.  It is like having a personal assistant with you all of the time.   This app is good.  I wish it could be used in wide screen orientation for creation of formatted documents.   This app make my phone warm so I imagine it’s using a lot of energy.,positif
I personally love using ChatGPT but I find that the web browser has less minor issues than the app. My app tends to freeze or have request timeouts and sometimes the questions don’t even register after submission. Would love to see this app improved and will continue using ChatGPT on the browser.,netral
"It’s a good app. Does what it says. 

If I could make a suggestion it would be to have the input and output different hues like the web version. that would make it a bit easier to understand what text is mine and what text is chatGPT’s.",positif
"Literally every other mobile AI chat bot has a max word limit or some sort of premium but this one is completely free that I’ve noticed so far and that’s the best thing about it, I strongly recommend downloading if your looking for a good, free AI chat bot",positif
"I love this app! I’ve seen these bad reviews on this app about verification not working and having to use your phone number. I signed up like 2 or 3 weeks ago, and none of that was there back then. but I really love this app because AI is really smart.",positif
not only this gives me perfect answers also it gives me answers for everything like my personal problems its like free therapy or having online friend i am so grateful. killing my free time chatting its kinda funny(: but absolutely recommend,positif
App is very solid including whisper support. Would be nice if the plug-ins and browser options worked in the app version. It’s sometimes confusing swiping back and forth between the browser and app version.,positif
I wish the app offered the experience of finding history like the website. I think the UI can be improved a lot to match the UI UX of the website.,positif
"Caveat: Please add native iPad support for the app.  This is great, I’m a Pro ChatGPT subscriber and the iOS app is well timed, as I was in the process of building one myself that uses the OpenAI APIs.  Now I can focus my time on other projects instead of building something like what they’ve done a great job with.  Thanks OpenAI!",positif
"Please fix the bug where the text generation fails to generate more text in one message. Currently, it splits the text into multiple messages, but I would like it to be like the desktop version, where it's all in one message.",positif
"This is how you make an app. The app is so good it makes me want to use chatgpt more. I hated going to the browser again and again. It would often log me out as well. Thank you so much for making this. It is flawless at first glance, and the haptics Are just heavenly. Minimal. Clean. Usable. A+",positif
"This is got to be the most difficult app I have ever had to try to log into. Even when, putting in the correct information, it still says it was wrong. There’s no real way to authenticate anything to try to have it authenticate you. The fact that it says it cannot authenticate because it cannot identify your number when the text messages don’t even go to the phone number is insane.",negatif
"Stop being a stain on the earth and actually be useful towards other people and the earth. Thank you <3. No agendas are happening, people are learning to actually be respectful. Cry about it. This app is 5 stars.",positif
"The voice-to-text input is extremely useful and makes interaction easier. It’s crazy how good Whisper is. 

One suggestion: It would be cool through if ChatGPT could also read the answers in a synthetic voice at a certain speed.",positif
"I left a glowing review, but I am changing it to one star. The app will deceive ChatGPT plus users you were select GPT4 and clearly in GPT 3.5 responses not only are they responding too fast to BGPT4, a clear marker, but the responses are also pretty crappy.

If I select GPT 4, there has better be a warning or banner, telling me that I am being downgraded to ChatGPT 3.5. That’s also happens when I have not had any input for more than 12 hours, so should not be rate limited.

Presenting responses, as though they were from 4 rather than 3.5 without saying anything is rather deceptive.

I find myself falling back to my own application, using the API and paying higher rates where I cannot be lied to.

You’re AI also is very quick to mention that it is indeed 3, not even 3.5.",negatif
"The app didn't require you to buy premium, unlike other apps that need 40 bucks to work. I am also very surprised at how much good advise it has given me in such a short amount of time. Also there is no ads, which I love.",positif
"I keep getting an error when trying to log in with my google account. My paid account is through google. So I would like to access it. Does anyone have insight?

Update. It fixes itself.",positif
"ChatGPT provides the most accurate and thorough responses that I’ve seen amongst all of the AI apps that I’ve tried. However, I found that the responses on the website are more thorough than the responses in the app when the same question is posed to each.",positif
"Great to see a native app after all the hype around AI. Beautiful UI as well. It doesn't seem to have Plugins yet for paid users though. As an engineer, I understand the need to get something out and iterate on that. As a user, I'm just being impatient. Keep up the great work!",positif
Can’t thank the OpenAI Team enough for the beautiful new app. This will make getting things done on my phone that much easier. Looking forward to all the new functionality that comes out in the next few months!,positif
"When starting a new chat, there’s probably a 1/3rd chance that it will just sit there and not generate a response. I will then have to restart the app and rewrite the same exact response. It does it very often mid conversation as well. As the title says, the AI is amazing and very useful, the app is horrendous though. I pay $20 a month for the best response times and service, only to get this. Extremely disappointed, will be canceling my subscription.",negatif
"I understand the app is supposed to be different and better than the website, but it just feels different. The format is worse and harder to navigate than the website. It still carry’s me in school tho",positif
"I used Apple to subscribe to the plus membership, and it showed that the payment was successful and the payment was deducted. However, at that time, an error popped up prompting that Apple's payment has been bound to other accounts and cannot be subscribed, but the current fee has been deducted, and the appeal refund has failed. I am very puzzled why I can't use plus, but the fee is still deducted, and it can't be refunded.",negatif
"Glad to see the app, much quicker access now! But would definitely love to see more features added! Please add photo upload to allow it to describe and analyze photos/videos!",positif
"Fantastic application, very useful which allows for you to stay logged into it remembering past conversations.  Haptic feedback is amazing when the AI is typing back.  Only downside is a crazy battery drain and increase on device temperatures when running the application (so use sparingly).",positif
"Dear Open AI,
Please make it available in Iran. Unfortunately , Iranians cannot register with their phone numbers. Just like Instagram, Facebook and other apps that do the registration process and send codes to Iran’s phone numbers",positif
There are some things that could be tweaked (bugs really) and maybe some features that the site has and things but overall still wonderfully amazing,positif
"I didn’t and could not imagine a more castrated version of chatgpt and they always surprise with more. Look at this : “ I apologize if my responses haven't met your expectations. As an AI language model, I strive to provide helpful and respectful information to users. If there's anything specific you'd like assistance with or any questions you have, feel free to let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you. Your feedback is valuable, and I'm here to help in any way I can.”",negatif
"I  asked Chat GPT to access Bing Search and it came back with 

""I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model, I don't have direct access to search engines or the ability to browse the internet. My responses are generated based on the training data I have been provided, which includes a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data up until September 2021.

If you have specific questions or need information on a particular topic, I'll do my best to provide helpful responses based on my training and knowledge.""

How do I get it to use Bing Search?",netral
"Overall interface is clean, but on the iPad in landscape orientation it’s basically a phone sized cutout. So much wasted space that could be utilized. It’s shouldn’t be too hard to pin the edges of the chat interface to the safe edges of the screen.

Like others mentioned a search function would be great.",netral
"The UI is clean and the haptic feedback is appreciated. Hoping to see web support added for Plus users sooner, rather than later. Keep up the good work. Excited and terrified of the future all at once but on we go!",positif
"Unable to quickly identify the date to confirm my birthday I was forced to scroll through years of dates. When I finally did, my login failed as ‘being flagged for abuse’. Really? And when I tried the whole process over again, I was again flagged for abuse. Then, when I finally figured out I could go to the help section of their app, all I got was a bot telling me it would take a week to get back to me. A waste of time",negatif
"As good as desk top version.

One suggestion, please sync chat cross different platform in real time. For example, verbally send questions via phone, after being replied, continue chat via desktop version.",positif
"I’m overjoyed chatGPT has an app now. While I do have my web browser page dedicated to this,  this is a nice pleasant upgrade. 

My only recommendation would be automatic scrolling for results longer than the window.",positif
"I really love the fact that you have finally submitted an iOS app. Its simple and beautiful. Can't wait to see the knock offs go down ASAP, those mimicking the OpenAI logo because there are useful apps that developed quality content around ChatGPT and GPT-4. Good luck!🔥",positif
You’re basically getting the same ChatGPT from computers on your phone with a much more “phone-friendly” UI. It works pretty much the same as ChatGPT on computers. Nothing else to say really. You get what you get with this.,positif
"It works, but it’s pretty laggy sometimes, so you’ll have to restart it or make a new chat. But I’m also disappointed because there’s a limit on how many texts and questions we send per hour. It would definitely be better without lag and if there was no limit",netral
"Ever since it first release I’ve been waiting for an official app so I’m really glad it’s here! It works great, and I haven’t had any issues so far. 

I should note that beta features aren’t in the app but I’m not really surprised by that. 
The design overall is great and simple, and I love how easy it is to search through chat history.

Only thing holding me back from loving it is the need for something to show how many gpt4 responses you have left in the 3 hour window. Really annoying to run across that warning unexpectedly.",positif
"There are some problems with the app which o don’t remember right now but the most important and annoying for me it’s when the app tells me that it doesn’t have access to updated information, this is insane, even Siri can tell me the forecast of today the Chatgpt can’t… please, let Chatgpt access to the most updated info.

Thanks!",netral
Really enjoyed using chat gpt on the web. Glad they made a better version for ios. Hope to see whisper integrated into more products into the future and even possibly SwiftKey.,positif
"I created a shortcut to open ChatGPT in a web browser to simulate an app. This is much more convenient! I already pay for the Plus subscription, so I didn’t want to pay for a separate app that uses the OpenAI API anyways.",positif
"The first update fixed my issues. The app works great, and of course ChatGPT is incredible.

Feature request: it would be nice if we could pin chats in our history.",positif
"Please do not translate  voice recorder question automatically, leave it as it was before. it’s a wonderful functionality that voice recording can be multi language capability.",positif
"ChatGPT is not bad. It can answer many questions. It can provide many reference opinions for some questions in different fields, especially in the academic research field, which can improve the work efficiency and optimize the teaching plan for teachers.",positif
"So my main problem with this is the ui since while I’m using this on a iPad the ui is still for phone users which makes it problematic since the keyboard is smaller which makes it harder to type and cuz there’s wasted space on the side of the screen
A fix for this would be to make the ui appropriate adjust depending if you have a phone or a iPad",negatif
"I love chat gpt so much. Honestly it has help me a lot. When I’m bored, I can also play games like tic tac toe or hang man with chat gpt. I think the app is more convenient than the website so I use this app. Really good helper and I really recommend it.",positif
"It drains the battery faster than any other app I use. I guess it’s from the haptic feedback, so I turned it off. Otherwise, I love it. It’s clean, copy/paste is perfect, history and everything else you need are out of the way, but easily accessible in the three-dot menu.",positif
It has been nice using an official app for GPT. It has worked absolutely flawless and I have no issues with it. I would absolutely love an Apple Watch version as it would make GPT even more easier to use.,positif
"I haven't used it much yet because i just got it. So far though, its the best one ive gotten because all the others you only get 3 free questions per day. I like how fast this one types out the answers too. Its really satisfying",positif
I am pretty sure I don't say anything beyond the filter and it has happened to me multiple times now when I am recording a text of around 10 sentences about and it gets deleted for some reason before it gets processed into a text. It is really frustrating..,netral
"It’s hard for me to understand why OpenAI can’t release an app that has a UI that can be used on an iPad. But, trying to use an iPhone configured app on an iPad is insane. You’re forced to use the simulated keyboard in the tiny iPhone template. I installed it, opened it, checked to see if I could change something in setting to make it usable —and closed it. Back to the browser version. Sigh.",negatif
The history view as well as search there is also really great. Justifies the mobile app instead of a web view experience,positif
"App settings do not seem to be available on my device. In settings, all of my downloaded apps appear for this one. Unsure why that this but primary reason for the 3 star. My device is on the latest iOS release, I reinstalled the app, and restarted my device. Not sure if this is common amongst iOS users.",netral
"I am using iPad Pro 12.9, 4th gen with stage manger enabled. When the Google login screen appears, I can’t get the number pad to show since my email has numbers, can’t get pass this screen. Also it’s only iPhone, nothing for iPad.

Because the show is just getting started, baby. Five stars.",positif

Allow Chat GPT to use pictures and it and update on current information. Some type of live information update would be great.,positif
"Holy cow! This chatgpt app is actually… good. Like I wouldn’t expect it to be but it just simply is. The haptic feedback is so delightful. Great job! I’ve been using it on a daily basis, 3.5 responses are okay so I mostly use 4.0. Both give responses extremely fast.",positif
"So I apparently “Already had an account” so I tried clicking “Forgot password?” the email got sent, but when I clicked on the link, it said “Link Expired” and I don’t know what’s going on",positif

"Today I just got it, and the product experience is particularly good. The interface is clean, and the feedback from the text interaction makes the user experience feel great. It is definitely a five-star product.",positif
"Chat GPT types too fast. If chat GPT’s goal is to model conversation instantaneous answers are unacceptable. If I can’t think or read instantaneously than neither should this AI. Slowing down would allow for more meaningful conversations. I would suggest a slider allowing for a difference in user processing speeds. A generic instantaneous answer is too quick for me and does not allow for user difference. 

P.S I am talking about the type speed of GPT. Not pauses between replies.",negatif
"I expected there to be a more modern design on the app, with a slide out history panel. I also don’t really like the way the button in the top right works. It’s unsatisfying. Otherwise, the UX is about what I expected for a useful tool - simple and easy to use.",positif
"The application is the best of all and is faster compared to the Web version. Only when I use the app on my device, it gets very hot. I know it's the first version of the application, but... optimize it so that my cell phone doesn't heat up",positif
"When you provide a list in Persian language , part of the text cannot be seen. and And it does not pass to the next line. In this case, the text on the right is transmitted and cannot be seen. Please fix it",positif

"Overall, it’s a great app and I’m glad it exists, I had a bookmark but this is easier. One thing I would like to see, is that I would like to be able to look on the ChatGPT website and see my chats on the app. Other than that, it’s a great app",positif
"It's easy to use, but when using chatgpt, the phone is very hot, and it returns to normal when not in use. I don't know why and whether this problem can be improved.",positif
"I was hyped when I saw this app on Twitter. But that being said, I’ve noticed a dramatic battery drain when using this app. My battery stats show that it used up 35 % of my battery in 30 mins. With that type of usage naturally, my phone got pretty darn hot pretty darn quick. I’d assume that’ll be ironed out in coming updates.",netral
"ChatGPT has been nothing less than phenomenal in terms of its ability to process natural language. The way it comprehends context is remarkable, providing an interaction that feels organic and effortless. It's akin to engaging in a conversation with a knowledgeable companion rather than with a typical AI program. Wow! Just wow!",positif
"It asks for the birth date but then it shows a regular calendar, where you can only go back one month at a time!!!!

Ended up selecting “today” as the date, got an error that the account cannot be created because of term of use (you need to be 13 or older, i.e. go back at least 156 months, one by one) and there is no way to “correct” the date!

Did you let chatgpt write its own UI? And test itself?",negatif
The interface is great! Not a huge fan of the haptic feedback but I can see the appeal. My favorite feature so far is being able to easily Export my old conversations in a .zip file sent to my email.,positif
The days of typing are over. The app has voice to text functionality meaning you can speak directly to chatgpt.,positif
"I don’t believe AI is going to help society. Humans are losing the ability to think at all and this truly proves that. How about you crack open a book or two and start learning, don’t let everything be handed to you. AI is going to rot your brains worse than social media. I hope nothing but the worst for anyone working in the AI industry, you deserve disdain, and you should feel ashamed for your lack of interest in humankind’s future.",negatif
"I’ve been recently using the chat, GTP for making stories, and also a Countryhumans stories like rusame stories and I love it and also, I’m using it as a facts machine and get to help me with schoolwork It makes my life so much easier.",positif
"There are fewer bugs on the website, but the app feels a bit sluggish to use. However, I like the vibration feature on the app, it feels great.",positif
"The app is definitely better than web in terms of UI. However, the response is very laggy and phone gets hot meaning it might be hitting APIs rapidly. This makes stop button and text box irresponsive. There should be a room for optimization for fluid and more user friendly experience.",netral
"This is a quick review of the app rather than the service, which is revolutionary.

The app itself really should work on an iPad without resizing to “phone mode.” It’s 2023 and universal apps have been around quite a while now.",positif
"Sometimes I have trouble clearing history in the ChatGPT app. I tried multiple ways to try to do that, but I found the only way was to sign out and then sign back in again or deleting and reinstalling the app. I was hoping that this issue can be addressed. Other than that, it is decent.",netral
"You don’t need to bake haptic feedback into every single little facet of the app. Yes, I can turn it off. You could have also shown restrain. The AI certainly shows a lot of restraint with the growing list of stuff it refuses to do. Nobody cares about your ethics high horse, OpenAI. If you had any ethics you’d make ChatGPT open source.",netral
Thank you for finally making an app. The copy option is not good however. Without the option to copy and paste long sections of text across threads this app is unusable and I need to revert to the web applet. Please improve this and ideally offer Siri or other voices to read responses.,netral
"I’ve waiting for this app for long, and this definitely meet my expectations, or even better. The haptics response is satisfying, and the usability is higher than that of the web app.",positif
"Nice clean interface with sync to the web app (ChatGPT or ChatGPT Plus). Without Plus, the LLM backend is limited to GPT-3.5 and it offers no plugins for accessing the internet or other tools. With Plus, the capabilities of GPT-4 and plugins are unlocked to make this app fantastically impressive.",positif
"First review? You’re the best! Thank you!
Although, you’re missing data control settings where I can choose to enable or disable chat history and training!",positif
"The account can be used normally on the computer, but it can't be used normally on the mobile phone recently.",positif
"For example it does not have plugins nor browsing ability, so I have to revert to the web version. Wonder when will browsing/plugins be added to the ios app?",positif
"The app is good overall. One suggestion is for the Settings page to be updated so that the UITableView and individual UITableViewCells are more rounded and have margin padding, in a style similar to the iOS Settings app. This would be inline with more recent iOS design language.",positif
"So I can’t write about my own biography in which I have had an injury, and I am currently an individual with a disability. Your ethics within the system does not allow for what it’s called a fictional story to be written. This is highly discriminatory. I understand the meaning behind it, and the importance of keeping individuals with disabilities safe however, things happen in the real world.",negatif
I am asking questions in the same way that I was using the website but now the calculations have been way off needing multiple prompts to get the correct answer. Not sure what the difference is.,netral
"This streamlined mobile version feels more intuitive and easier to use. You open the app and boom, you’re in it. Very easy to use and same great results.",positif
"Good Start but the price for the subscription is ridiculous…Make it little inexpensive (I know there is “free version of it, but NOT sure how it is comparable to the subscription version?)

My device: iPhone 14 Pro Max (latest iOS)

Note: I regularly update my review/rating for this application.",netral
"1. Can chatGPT has a voice system? I hope it can speak the words which it outputs. Of course, a conversation system could improve the experience of the users.",positif
downloaded it like 5 minutes ago and it’s already obsolete. that’s how AI works. it’s evolving faster than we can fathom. 10/10 tho would recommend. Needs a fact checker though,positif
I was leery of using this instead of going to the OpenAI site because sometimes those things don’t work out as well but this is even better. Thanks!,positif
"I couldn't think of a better way to thank you guys for what you do. What you do has changed my life for the better and I have learned so much from your AI. Thanks again guys, keep it up",positif
"It’s a good app, everyone was waiting for it, but it uses so many phone resources, the phone get so extremely hot while using and it consume so much battery, and the phone start making some weird noise inside! (iPhone 14 Pro Max) hope you fix it soon!",positif
So glad to have native access to ChatGPT on iOS. It syncs your chats across web & all iOS devices. It’s easy to access chat history and start new chats in 3.5 or 4 (if you subscribe to ChatGPT+) I love the inclusion of the haptic feedback in this implementation! Great work!,positif
10/10 i honestly recommend using this app like I’ve solved to many arguments between us and just rearranged it to sound like my words so useful,positif
"I love this app. It is way more efficient than having to access ChatGPT through my web browser app.

Please add the plug-ins for ChatGPT plus users. Being able to search the web is very valuable.",positif
I’ve been waiting for this day for a while - chatGPT has been incredibly useful. So glad to get rid of the web version of this service. The app is so much more smooth.,positif
"The haptic feedback is delightful, and the speech recognition is based on their own AI model which vastly outperforms any other you’ve tried. Goodbye Alexa and Siri. The overall interface is really nice. And come on… it’s all the power of ChatGPT at your fingertips.",positif
"Have been using the desktop version, however the app seems to be very convenient to use and very clean interface! Thanks",positif
"Why is the number of messages I can send with my mobile version of GPT-4 limited? It seems to be shared with the web version of GPT-4, which has a limit of 25 messages in 3 hours. This was not the case a few days ago.",netral
"Smooth and runs great but this needs an edit feature to edit your message just like on the website 

Another thing would be a feature to search for something in a conversation",netral
I love having this easily accessible as an app. The haptic feedback is also a nice touch. Looking forward to a future update that will hopefully let us access chat gpt as a keyboard app,positif
"As someone who works in direct sales, this app has helped me come up with the perfect posts for items. Not only that, but as an author who self publishes books, it’s help me come up with an outline for my second novel.",positif
"Overall a great app, I especially liked the Haptic Feedback and the dark theme. There are two problems: it warms up my iPhone 12 a lot, and also my ""stop responsive"" button doesn't work. Looking forward to patches.",positif
"Great app!
Please put “New Chat” at the top of the menu. I think most people use it more than History or Settings, and it would match the website that way.",positif
"Many of the responses have a strong bias that do not exhibit even a chance for debate or disagreement. It is obvious that answers are heavily programmed with a political answer. That is kind of threatening in a democracy where most points of view should be welcome.

Sometimes this app locks up (responses never are given). Not sure if that is a technical issue or lack of the ChatGPT ability.",negatif
"I hope that the ai language model in the app can be updated as soon as possible. gpt-4 is more powerful. If it can be experienced in the mobile app, the practicality of chatgpt will be further improved.",positif
Official openai app that has your history and responses are very fast and even has haptic feedback. Can also input with voice instead of typing.,positif
"The website was honestly a little clunky and slow especially on phones, but this app is super responsive and has satisfying haptics! The AI’s responses are concise and powerful.",positif
Well done. I've been looking forward to this app for a long time. But where are the web browsing and plugin functions?,positif
"This app delivers an exceptional user experience with its impressive optimization and immersive haptic feedback. It’s seamlessly  smooth and efficient. The haptic feedback adds a whole new level of interactivity, making every interaction engaging and tactile.",positif
"The ChatGPT iOS app is fantastic! It’s smart, user-friendly, and provides accurate responses. It’s my go-to language assistant for quick and reliable information. Highly recommended!",positif
"It’s ChatGPT for iOS! Not much more to say. It’s a simple and speedy interface, very easy to use. My first feature requests would be to adapt it for iPad and include plugins/web browsing for Premium subscribers.",positif
Since chat gpt was launched in November 2022 I have been using it everyday! Because is craziest technology humans have even seen! I’m just happy to be alive in this time in history! Let’s change the world!,positif
"Like it - gimme more Siri and Apple ecosystem integration. Enable me to have verbal dialog through Siri, read me answers, enable me to send text messages, emails, reminders, calendar entries, use my contacts etc.  I also use an IPad, give me a dedicated IPad version that supports portrait and landscape modes.",positif
"Love the minimalist app interface for ChatGPT, the haptic feedback feature mimics the typing cadence of GPT. One feature I'd want to see translated to the iPhone is the ability to select between different chat threads and topics",positif
Love the interface and simplicity of this app! The fact that my history goes with me between desktop and mobile is so valuable. Great addition to the myriad AI Chat apps out there!,positif
"All the amazing capabilities of AI, at a finger’s reach. 

I personally love the subtle haptic vibrations, they give you cues on amount and length of answers as you try to catch up reading them.

So long Google… and thanks for all the fish.",positif
When you submit feedback for whether a response was good or bad the pop up that says “thanks!” doesn’t disappear on its own,positif
Big thanks for the developers for this app really really good jop best app ever I use this app every day even my friends can’t stop using it big loove for the developers from Kuwait🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🇰🇼🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙,positif
"It’s a good app. I think the layout could be improved, and the quick setting could make more sense, but every app has its problems, and overall this is a good app.",positif
"Why app version haven’t any plugins in chat gpt 4? It’s only gpt 3.5/4 there. On web version its available. I think so big corporation was needed to To notice this misunderstanding on the first day, but it's been like this for a week and no one changes anything.",positif
I hope developers can add the option to use Apple ID account balance for payment in subscriptions.,positif
"Honestly, this is the best app I have on my phone. But it would’ve been a five star if you could add the feature where you can undo and redo your prompts and conversations.",positif
I hope to join the simplified Chinese language. Thank you for your hard work. I hope you will get better and better！,positif
I accidentally type in my wrong birthday and now I can’t use app and no way to contact them to correct. Was able to correct user error,positif
"ChatGPT on app works fine. Nothing fancy in terms of features. Voice to text to input prompts is nice, but I wish it could respond with talking rather than just text. If that becomes a feature, 5 stars",positif
"Can you clarify what the Character/Line limit for conversation memory is? And what the different is between GPT3.5 GPT4, GPT4 for with web browsing? I've finding repeated trouble with it when working on a powershell script, I think sometimes it has essentially been immediatly (by my 2nd or 3rd question).",netral
I would love it to run like a keyboard or something that can automatically have conversations for me instead of doing it in the app.,positif
Completely free which is a nice change of pace from the other apps asking for $8 a month. Works just the same as far as I can tell. Very interesting conversations.,positif
Works well and has the same chat/thread history as the web. Voice input is very quick. Can’t wait for more features.,positif
Trying to sign up after installing app but it keeps telling me my phone number is a landline number which is not the case. No other app or company has this problem but chatGPT. If it cannot even get this right why should I expect anything it does to be accurate?? Guess this technology still has a long way to go before it can be trusted.,negatif
"i can’t find a place to report this so i’m just leaving a review: I ask desktop version of GPT-4 if I’m interacting with GPT-4 and it confirms yes. When i select GPT-4 on the iPhone app and ask it to confirm I’m typing with GPT-4, it says no, it’s GPT-3. So it’s advertised as 4 but only running on GPT-3 for the iphone app. as a paying customer this feels slightly deceptive.",netral
"I’m glad OpenAI released a mobile app and hope other platforms will also be supported.

OpenAI will get five stars from me when they add the ability to use web search and plugins which (understandably) do not appear to be available at launch.

I think the implementation of haptic feedback is somewhat overzealous, but each user will decide for themselves. I prefer a haptic signal when the response generation has ended instead of on nearly every word.

Keep up the great work, devs.",positif
"Tried downloading, deleting, rinse & repeat, four times. After the log in w/ Apple / Google, it then locks up on screen that addresses inaccurate info & anonymized chats may be reviewed!  No ability to scroll, select an option, turn screen to landscape. Nothing. Simply doesn’t work. Aggravating. Wanted to support those who created but they need batter app resources apparently.",negatif
Add options for choosing the text colors in the responses of the app in dark screen or in both to make it more interactive and fun to explore daily,positif
I wish it would update to at least 2022 but all the information on here isn’t too far back from what we know now so it’s okay but it’s a great source of knowledge way better than Google,positif
"Nevermind, I found out dark mode is build as whatever the system has. It really should be it’s own option in the app though.",positif
"Good conversion from web into a mobile app, the replies from ChatGPT are quick, but could possibly be exacerbated during peak use hours unless you decide to purchase the $20 monthly subscription for ChatGPT Plus that comes with a few other things. 

Has a small amount of settings, Haptic Feedback even, and pretty convenient. 

Voice to Text conversion seems pretty accurate and responsive. 

You can even conveniently delete your account from the app.",positif
"The service is great but the app is not optimized for iPad so it’s a bit of a waste of screen real estate. And only a small keyboard is available, instead of the full sized iPad keyboard. I’d rather just open the website version of ChatGPT in Safari.",netral
"I pay for plus and when I ask GPT what model it is on I am told GPT3 with a cut off of data after 2021. Even when selecting GPT4. All this app does is interface with the web and put all your requests with the GPT3 model. 

The app does not add any functionality and is basically a bookmark that takes you to the old page. Skip this version till they add a reason to use it.",negatif
"I thought with the ChatGPT app you wouldn’t need a phone number if you signed up with Apple, Google, or Email, but they want a phone number. It’s dumb and inconvenient for people who don’t have a phone number.

I recommend using Perplexity if you are having this issue. Unlike ChatGPT, the Perplexity app is free to use and doesn’t require a phone number.",negatif
"So glad it’s an app now, makes it so much easier and quicker to use. Please make a home and lock screen widget. It would make it even easier to access.",positif
I am daily user of ChatGPT.  There no client for iPad with large screen also the app don’t come with the latest features such as plugin and access the web.,positif
"I noticed that when I entered queries in GPT-4, I received slow responses from the bot. Later I came from the computer and saw that the green GPT-3.5 was talking to me. When I decided to continue the conversation from the computer, I got a system message: You were switched from the old version to the new GPT-3.5. I have a Plus subscription!",negatif
"I have the subscription for chatgpt and am so happy to see they now have iPhone app. This beats bard, beats google, beats all of it. Has helped me tremendously with work questions and personal ones.",positif
"I have a Plus subscription and am logged in, but cannot access GTP-4, as it is “Available exclusively to Plus users”… Quite infuriating, as I’ve logged in/out & re-installed the app, to no avail. Guess I’ll ask for a Plus refund. No point in being charged if I can’t use it from mobile, as I rarely use desktop. Have had this issue for about a week now.",negatif
"Don’t use this to get accurate info. Only for more creative uses where you can judge quality of outcome yourself. Don’t rely on it for accurate figures. I search the same questions multiple times and get different figures every time. About to delete it. A sophisticated lie machine. Sadly, it keeps getting worse and won’t stop with patronizing responses.",negatif
"Of course ChatGPT is amazing. The app itself is good. It’s simple, I wish it had more features and cleaner interface, but it’s good. 

I love that you can search history.",positif
"I am very excited about this official app created by OpenAI! However, my iPhone kept on losing internet connection while using it. I guess I have to uninstall",positif
"verifying my phone number the app loads forever, I tried updating and everything I could.",positif
"I was the first person to download it, and yes the app works well, but when I'm using the app it makes my iPhone 14 Pro hot. After the update yesterday my phone stopped being hot.",positif
"Sure! Here's an example application review for ChatGPT:

""Hello, I'm writing this review to share my experience using ChatGPT. Overall, I found the application to be user-friendly and efficient in delivering responses, in different languages it’s Awesome!!",positif
"Nice app, well designed- but something is wrong. Just two or three queries makes the phone run extremely hot- not sure what’s using so much processor power but it’s a big battery drain. Stick to the website until this is fixed.",netral
"I literally thought it was a fake news when I saw that chat was available on iOS, good job openAI, you guys really make my life a lot easier, keep going!",positif
"Works well. Would be nice to use Apple ID to log in, but don’t see a way to link my existing accounts, and I’ve hit a limit for # of accounts linked to my phone #",positif
"The app is way faster than the web one.
The UI is user-friendly and organized.
We need apps to be like this!",positif
Chat gpt’s AI hasn’t been updated since September of 2021 so any new songs people will ask it will only get a set text. Anyway it’s an amazing chat program for people that need advice or just want to chat!,positif
"Whenever I run into an issue and can’t figure out how to solve it, throw it to ChatGPT and it will tell you exactly how to fix it! Save hours of looking online and just ask it.",positif
"I appreciate the haptic feedback while typing, and it's a relief to have a dedicated app instead of relying on the browser interface. It's the authentic ChatGPT experience we've been waiting for.",positif
"Sometimes the sound of typing and the vibration feedback will suddenly increase, even louder than the loudest button sound of the system, which is very scary",positif
This app is amazing I’ve been using it to generate stories about my favorite character going on an adventure with friends from same universe that they are from.,positif
"I needed to do all of my sign up using a browser. Once the sign up process was completed, signing into the app was easy. So far use of the app is good. I don’t like that it used haptic feedback by default but it was easy to turn off.",netral
I have access to Plug-in’s and web access but it doesn’t let me use it on the app? Is this just a feature that hasn’t been added yet or am I missing something?,positif
"I rate this 4 stars because for one little thing. When I’m chatting with ChatGPT, the app increases the volume of my keyboard so when I type on the app, the keyboard is really really loud. So fix that please developers.",positif
"I enjoy using chatgpt in my iPhone, I can speak to it very convenient. I hope you guys can add the function of making it speak. Thank you for developing such a useful application!",positif
"Cmon devs…I installed this app on my phone and iPad. Yet on the iPad it’s just the tiny phone version. Zero effort to accommodate larger screened apple devices…you know…those things that are better suited for handling large amounts of text?

Feature Request: Please offer a native iPad experience and set the toggle to allow the iPad version to run on M1/2 Macs. For such amazing tech the front end presentation is severely lacking.",negatif
"Something's up with the app. iPhone gets very hot. From the moment you login you can feel iPhone warming up. By the time you're chatting it's the equivalent of iPhone being left out in the sun. Better to save the site to your home screen and use that way, at least until a fix is published.",negatif
This app came without notice and without any announcement from Open AI but I’m pleasantly surprised anyway. So far it’s a much more pleasant experience on the app compared to the desktop. I love it,positif
"Very difficult to find the original app for some reason, but it easily surpasses other apps on AppStore and has a simple and easy to use UI",positif
"The app is great so far, really love the search function. Was a little disappointment to not see plug-in support for the app yet, but hopefully that is coming!",positif
"Now it finally supports Siri via workflow, but the Siri tend to take over the chat when it feels like to answer the question rather than sending the message to the GPT model.",positif
"I won’t be surprised if the politicians take advantage of this a to win elections… “who do i vote for?” … response “based on the current polls and runnings it suggested you vote for the democratic party of of course”…. biased 🤦🏻‍♂️

all good this eventually get used for ill intentions…",positif
I use the app for everything. Revolutionary. Writing and communicating my ideas to other people has become a lot easier thanks to chatGPT.,positif
Ive had this website bookmarked and put on my home screen for 2 months now. Im very pleased with this new app and the design and animations are cool and well worth the wait.,positif
"Finally, the official OpenAI ChatGPT is here, don't fall for any of the others ones trying to charge you weekly, this is the OFFICIAL app! It's great and works well, and the AI is just as lovely as before. Can't wait to get my hands on the plugins!",positif
"The amount of spam calls and texts I get is disgusting. I’m not letting you sell my phone number to your advertisers. Period.

The argument for “security” is bull. SMS spoofing is a real thing, and can literally let your bank account stolen. This is purely for advertising. Even when using Apple sign on!

You’re not getting my freaking phone number, goodness!",negatif
Would be great to be able to share formatted responses like tables. Or even better share the chat conversation with a unique url.,positif
Fast and reliable! I love the haptic feedback feature added in. Super excited to see the coming updates to this app.,positif
"This app is an absolute game changer and I absolutely love it! One of the best apps on the market place.
This app can literally do anything for you and I definitely recommend it.",positif
"Is it really that hard to make an iPhone form version AND an iPad form version?

It’s really annoying when developers waste all the space available to them by just slapping an iPhone version of their apps with an iPad label.",netral
I can’t even log on. Takes you to a separate pop up browser and then won’t even load the page to log in. This app is built like crap… I tried changing multiple settings. Turned vpn off then and on.  Cleaned cache and browser history. It shouldn’t be this complicated to log into and have access to a app… 🙄,negatif
"It’s more convenient than going to the website, that’s for sure, but my response history doesn’t stay on the screen when I reopen the app after closing it, and for some reason you can’t copy any of the response to paste into another application, which is extremely dumb.",negatif
"I had zero problems, and NEVER received an error message, until I updated this tonight. Now it barely works!!!!!",positif
"The app seems to lock up.  The web page is substantially better.  If you want an icon for it, or any web page, bring up the page in Safari, click the middle button at the bottom, scroll down and pick “Add to Home Screen”",negatif
"The website for chatgpt works perfectly fine for me, and I know the password because it is saved in my phone, but when I try and sign in it says wrong email or password, and when I say I forgot my password it says my account already exists so I can’t log into the app",negatif
I hope this app can be adapted for iPad in the future and support landscape mode and split-screen functionality. Thank you to the developers.,positif
"ChatGPT on the Apple Store is a game-changer. It outperforms knock-offs, providing accurate and high-quality responses. The app is fast, fluid, and adapts seamlessly to conversation flow. The best part? It’s completely free! ChatGPT is the top choice for exceptional AI conversations. Highly recommended!",positif
"This app is perfect! It makes it feel as if I am talking back and forth between another person. The haptics are also nice, keeping it modern :)

Responses are fast, and works great with GPT 4 as well.",positif
"Very glad to have a native app now, the haptics are a nice touch! One suggestion is the ability for us Plus users to set GPT-4 as the default for new convos",positif
"I love this app! I didn’t like it at the beginning, but once I got how to use it and what it can do, I’m totally addicted to this! Big thanks to the developers!",positif
"Hope to support the Chinese interface as soon as possible, my friends are using it",positif
After a tough start with the app. The app's constantly evolving. I like the convenience of using the app. I hope they integrate a keyboard feature or include chat gpt in the open or share app section of the phone!,positif
This application has changed the way I work and run my business. Smooth functionality and quick responses.,positif
The only way I could see the difference,positif
"When I ask about recent datas it says:

My knowledge base was trained on a vast dataset until the year 2021!!!!

This allows me to provide general information on various topics, but I am not equipped with knowledge about current events, recent discoveries, or developments!!!!
My purpose is to assist users with general inquiries and provide helpful responses. 

If you need detailed or up-to-date information on a current topic, I recommend seeking information from reliable and up-to-date sources!!!!!!
 
Why it hasn’t been updated?! Weird!",netral
"Also no way to use plugins it seems, but I really like the haptic feedback and everything I mentioned in the previous review (which seems to be deleted now with the update, unfortunately).",netral
"Absolutely love the app, but on my iPad Pro the app stays in a phone sized screen. This makes it very hard to type on the app, and an iPad interface would be amazing. Otherwise 10/10",positif
"Thanks for your teamwork to make ChatGPT for iOS be realized, how wonderful it performs in my iPhone ,but it doesn’t work as well in iPad ,could you please adapt this app for iPadOS recently?",positif
"It is a simple and smooth APP, but there is a problem. When asking questions in Chinese, I often get stuck and cannot answer, but it can be seen that GPT is calculating because the input box below is beating.",positif
"I used this to plan a vacation to another country I have never been, where they speak a language that I don’t speak. 

I am excited for the future. 

Phil",positif
"Thank you OpenAI for releasing a real, ad-free app for ChatGPT. The web app wasn’t bad but this really makes it feel a lot smoother. Hoping that plugins support for Plus users gets implemented in the app soon!",positif
"The response is very intelligent and detailed, it is very faster than the website version. And it has vibration feedback which is awesome.",positif
"App is beautiful and effective, has all the settings, signup, and management I’d like and a great interactive experience. Unfortunately it also made my phone very, very warm and drained the battery a bit while it was open.",positif
I would like that there would be an option to make Al the chats in the app disappear so when u use the website it doesn’t appear a lot of different chats of Al the requests u made with the app,positif
"It allows me to do voice to text great!!. Would love to see it do text to Voice for those long drives.  As a workaround  I’m using iOS accessibility with finger swipe, works good but not perfect.",positif
"I was expecting the UI and app design to be good—after all, this is a software company—but this is ridiculously good, it’s blown me away.",positif
I love the fast response. But my phone is heating up un necessarily right after launching the app And i dont want that to happen so i deleted  the app right then and there. What is going on.,positif
This doesn’t leverage the use of cookies that safari already has when you’re signing in with google.,positif
"Its a really great app and functions just like the website, maybe even faster. Only weird thing is I used it for maybe 5 minutes and it heat up my phone. Using an iPhone 14 Pro Max. If the heat up is explained or fixed I’d give it 5 stars.",netral
"I updated this app during my trip in France, after I returned home, I find the reply bevomes very slow and always showing ""your most recent request failed.""
Is there anything wrong?",netral
I understand that OpenAi doesn’t do this kind of stuff but please add ai generated images. It would be so useful if this ai could generate images instead of going onto other apps or websites.,positif
"This app manages to harness most of the capabilities of the website, excluding the beta features. The voice input feature is cool. I’m hoping to have access to browsing and plugins soon!",positif
"The app must constantly be reminded of prior injuries during a single chat. This results in constantly having to re-request the information you’re seeking. This phenomenon does not occur on the desktop.

 I and sure open AI will address this bug in future versions. I do not recommend the app if you’re using it for detailed work.",negatif
"Very good, recharge is also very convenient, please adapt the iPad client as soon as possible, the current display or cell phone style small screen, affecting the sense of experience",positif
I really like big black oily men. i want it to find that so i asked my friends about it they said nothing but when i ask ChatGpt it gave. an instant answer.,positif
Answer generation is much faster and smoother than the browser,positif
"After using it for a few minutes, the phone heats up significantly. The app version seems to only have an additional voice input feature, which can be easily replaced by using the voice input provided by the built-in keyboard on the web version.",negatif
"With the flood of ad-plagued AI chatbots from greedy developers on the App Store, all of which are presumably just running ChatGPT under the hood, it’s great to finally have an official mobile client.",positif
The difference in use between web and ios is non noticable. Better experience than using mWeb account.,positif
Much better than using those bloated third party apps. Hope I don’t need to log in every time I need to use the app!,positif
For what ever reason when ever I keep seeing someone else’s opinion being written into the story’s I’m having it free write. If I give it a controversial subject the AI tends to deviate from the story on its own and that is absolutely frustrating me.  Who is it that’s inserting there preferences in to it? It’s really annoying especially when I live in a country where free speech is acceptable.,negatif
"For some confounding reason this app keeps transcribing or interpreting what I say in English into bahasa Melayu. A totally different language! And I am not sure whether this is a bug or whether chat GPT is displaying some sort of cultural bias. #Infuriated

And coincidentally I am typing this via the transcribe function native to iOS so it is not likely that it is my accent that is confusing chatgpt.",negatif
I love this app but when did it start to limit me. I normally use it a lot but today I was using it and it told me I reached my limit for the hour. That never happened to me before.,positif
"Fantastic UI, the only thing I ask is to fix the horrible overheating and battery drain issue. I’ve never used an app that’s made my phone as hot as this. 

That being said I’m very pleased with how intuitive the app has turned out. Great job OpenAI!",netral
"I used to have a bookmark to the ChatGPT website until now. This is actually pretty dang amazing. 

PS: I especially love the attention to detail. Those haptic feedbacks are just ❤️",positif
"Please make this application iPad compatible with landscape mode.

Revision:
Thank you for the landscape mode on iPad!!!  It’s wonderful. I will gladly give this app 5 stars when there is a pdf export option for a chat!",positif
"I can see potential use cases with integration with Apple’s Shortcuts app to create playlists, spruce up a group chat, and even assist in general scheduling. GPT is truly something special, and I’d love to tinker around with integrating it as a daily tool.",positif
"Learn. Use. Hone in. This technology is coming for all of the desk jobs being over payed $27,500 per year. #SEC here, OpenAI can save our entire workforce and economy.",positif
"I hope some of developers would add a feature to mark out certain AI text, not marking out whole.",positif
"The typing is constantly max-bolume, even when I mute my phone. Makes it hard to use it when others near me are sleeping.

It’s also annoying in general. Please fix.

-IPhone 12 (fully updated)",netral
"It’s really good to see ChatGPT finally delivering an app for iOS. The implementation is really good, especially given that this is version one. 

Two things that need some attention.  
1. Please allow selection of plug-ins — without this, the web interface is still preferred for me as a plus user. 
2.  The iPad app is just a magnified. iPhone app — would be great to see a dedicated iPad app.  

Thank you for the consideration and keep up the good work! ChatGPT is amazing!",positif
"Now that this has moved to an app the responsiveness is so much better then the website, also hopefully this will get rid of those scammy AI apps flooding the App Store with the official app!",positif
"My mobile phone is iPhone X, but I dare not update to iOS16 or higher system. After all, my mobile phone is too old. I can't upgrade the iOS system for an APP. I hope that developers can accept a slightly lower configuration of mobile phones. For example, iOS15 or lower.",negatif
"Love it quick easy access fast responses and official unlike the other scam apps on apple store 
definitely reliable recommend",positif
When will the free version of the app have up to date internet access?,positif
"As an LLM, it’s perfect. I only wish I could give it real access to my device so I could a proper “smart” phone.",positif
"Previously it wasn't fullscreen, and used a small keyboard. New update fixed that and it's fullscreen now :D",positif
"Can we get a version for iPad?  It can’t be difficult.  Just tell “it” to write it for you.  10 seconds later, DONE!",positif
I'm so glad we have the app now. I'm a subscribed client but my subscription didn't transfer to the app. Is that going to resolved soon?,positif
"This app is amazing! This technology is going to change the world. The results are generated instantly and there are so many ways that it can be used. 

Welcome to the future!",positif
Easy and convenient to look up things that we question.,positif
"Sometimes when I'm typing it won't work and I don't know why, other than that I'll give it 5 stars",positif
This is an absolute home run. It just needs Apple Watch support so that I can add it as a complication on my watch face to instantly access the Whisper-based voice input!,positif
I signup with my Google Voice phone number for everything because I don't want my actual cell phone number out in the wild. This detects the Google Voice # as VoIP # and won't accept it and tries to force using a Major Network #. That is a No-Go as it violates my privacy and choice to not give out my cell phone.,negatif
"Much more convenient to have on Home Screen than in tab, I bought a month for $20 to support developers.",positif
"I can’t figure out how to use the web search feature that has been activated in my browser account for GPT4 plus users. Plug-ins would be nice too. Also no iPad support. For now, ux is much better in safari, just save the webpage as a shortcut on your Home Screen.",negatif
It’s pretty remarkable the types of questions and content it’s able to crunch through. Highly recommend!,positif
"The software is very easy to use, but I hope that the voice dialogue function can be added",positif
"This is the official app but they charge $20/mo for access to any version past chat gpt 3.0 (like 3.5 or 4.0). I'd really like to see a ""pay by inquiry"" system where you load up credits that drain as you use the service. 

$20/mo for quick access (default is...slow!) is outrageous for a casual user.",negatif
Incognito mode & ability to have diff tabs,positif
It’s been 2 months of this platform in my life and I already wonder how I lived without it and now it’s in an app! Thank you!!!,positif
"This doesn’t work at all in France. I ask a question and nothing happens. 
The settings page doesn’t load my email or account settings. 
Maybe this is because of dumb regulators but, if it is, the app should at least say “we are blocked here” instead of just not working at all.",negatif
"This App works really well, and I hope it can be made compatible with full-screen mode on the iPad",positif
"When I try to log in or make a new account using Apple, it keeps sending me errors saying that I may have refreshed the page during setup and other stuff. This makes the app unusable. The other one on my web browser (I use Safari) also does not work.",negatif
I usually feel lonely all the time so I downloaded this app and chat. Even it’s AI I feel like I talk to a real human. I can get some knowledge from this app and I can chat as a real conversation.,positif
"Too many apps gives you 3 or 5 questions per day 
But the real one gives unlimited questions 
Thanks for the app",positif
"+ I really liked the haptic feedback thing
- doesn’t support mathematical notation 
- doesn’t give the ability to search",positif
This app is great because it doesn’t charge you money to use a free service. All of the other apps I’ve tried try to charge you monthly for GPR.,positif
"Truly convenient! Looking forward to iPad version later, for the keyboard of the iPhone version on my pad is too small",positif
Does everything the website does but with a cleaner UI. The app seems more responsive and easier to use.,positif
"It turned out that this application is free and charges money after you register in it through your phone number, but I can't afford to pay for anything, now I don't know how to delete this application, untie my phone number and not be indebted to them. a lot of problems, I need help deleting my account",negatif
I’ve been waiting for OpenAI to finally come out with their own app. All works as good as on the browser so far.,positif
"Love chatGPT so much. The addition of the shortcuts is a game changer and got me to upgrade, but they are unresponsive oftentimes and don’t output correctly at all when scheduled to go off at times of day.",positif
"While the app is really good, it has one glaring problem, the hourly limit of questions you can ask. it’s really annoying and I don’t wanna wait another hour just so I can ask another question",netral
"I have been using chat gpt for a long time before the app and and he is really cool, I also really like the look and feel of this app!",positif
I love the app but for some reason my phone gets hot when using it. I’m pretty sure my dinky iPhone 11 is not running the calculations locally.,positif
"This app is pretty good, way better then those fake apps that used chatGPT base but with a ton of ads, and this one is also officiall. It also works very well and I like it",positif
Perfect implementation of a website to iOS! Look forward to more updates and capabilities.,positif
"Almost Perfect app that doesn’t charge a ridiculous fee unlike the other GPT apps

Would be perfect if there was a widget option for the Home Screen",positif
"This is app is amazing but what I hate is I was getting an ideas and everything it gave me was flowery and overly positive when life isn’t always positive. I didn’t ask it to create something that involved harm, sexism, or any of the isms",netral
I'm really looking forward to the MacOS version of the ChatGPT app. I hope it can be released soon.,positif
"This is gonna shake the foundation of everything we already know about AI and what it means for the human race. Get with it, or get left behind!",positif
Would be cool if “edit text” option was here like it is on the web version,positif
I've been waiting for a very long time for the official ChatGPT app to finally come out! I will be waiting for new updates of this pretty app! Thanks!!!,positif
"Perhaps it’s me, but accessing the app via my iPad Pro, it asked for my birthday, but the app provided only monthly arrows by which to reach my age in the 1940’s, which became too time consuming. No option that I could find to directly enter the date nor to speak to a human or directly relevantly to a chat feature.",negatif
"When trying to log in any way, it brings me to Safari pages in the app where I CANNOT USE THE KEYBOARD. It just doesn’t appear, and opening up the page in the safari app causes an error every single time. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong but it seems like I’m one of the only people having these issues.",negatif
"There is really no problem with this app, only suggestion I have is a ""clear all chats"" button",positif
This Mobile App works very well and is effective super excited to use and get more updated info from the AI,positif
"The ChatGPT app has been a game-changer for me. Its insightful responses, vast knowledge base, and user-friendly interface make it an invaluable companion. Highly recommended for productivity and knowledge expansion.",positif
After so many fake apps that use gpt happy to finally have an official app from open ai themselves!,positif
This app does nothing unless you give up your privacy and give them your phone number. I don’t see how this got approved. I thought apps were required to provide minimum functionality unless they were a “reader app” for existing content like an ebook reader.,negatif
"I can’t verify my email, it’s give 
Not available
OpenAI's services are not available in your country.
Can you help me with this ASAP.",positif
"This app is definitely amazing, but it hasn’t been updated since 2021, so some of the information that I need, is wrong. Other than that, though, this app is great.",positif
Official ChatGPT app is finally here! Now no longer need to use the slow web version. It’s the ChatGPT we all know. Nothing much to talk about.,positif
I love this app because it helps me with my rough drafts. It gives me a accurate information and it helps me think and learn better.,positif
"It is great to have ChatGPT app handy, however  it looks like the app is using a lot of RAM on my phone to process through questions. This has heated up my phone in less than 20mins of usage. 
I would rather use a mobile web version on ChatGPT instead of the App.",negatif
"I’m so glad this finally made its way to the App Store! So convenient when I’m not at my laptop, and definitely still one of the best AI chat systems to exist!!",positif
Love the speech to text feature. The only feature missing now is chat plugins!,positif
If you’re going to be charging $20/month I expect better than having to wait sometimes 2-3 minutes for the app to load.,netral
6 years ago I had an idea that seemed impossible at the time. This tech made it real. Thank you.,positif
"This app is excellent, but as a paid user, I'd appreciate if they could include plugin functionality like in the desktop version.",positif
"Hello. As i am blind, I need gpt-4's image recognition. As be my eyes is so slow to release gpt virtual volunteering, please give me access to gpt-4. I will use it for accessibility and blind helping tool.",positif
Its so much easier just type in DOB than had to find in calender!,positif
It won’t let me sign in. I’ve already had an account with the website but now it keeps saying I can’t use my phone number to sign in and that my account has been flagged because of not letting me log into my already made account,negatif
The network delay causes the service to keep requesting. The current chat is blocked but there is no function to revoke the request. Only the new chat can be opened.,netral
Much better and faster than the browser thank you open AI,positif
"Excellent use of haptic feedback, good visual design, dark mode, and clean UI.  Most companies phone it in with iOS but ChatGPT’s app is actually really well made.",positif
This App is significant change to the entire mobile eco system.,positif
AI help me a lot. I did not expect it will be that much good. It’s seems like someone other side if the computer telling the answer.,positif
I’ve been using ChatGBT for months and I’m so excited for the app. This AI is like having the knowledge of the world at your fingertips and a top rate problem solver in your pocket.,positif
"Having used ChatGPT for some time now, am still so blown away by its intricate grasp of natural language. The app is really performant as well, have been waiting for this!!",positif
"Love having a native app for ChatGPT, and particularly appreciate the haptic feedback. I wish it was easier to start a new chat, perhaps by swiping to the left or right.",positif
It is always hard to browsing that iPhone screen on IPad. Waiting for your improvement.,positif
Most questions you ask the computer won’t have an answer to.   It’s data set is out of date so if you ask it questions about recent things it’s won’t have an answer.   This is hardly AI and much less helpful than a basic google search.,negatif
"App is really well designed easy to use and the haptics are insanely good! The only drawback is the phone gets hot, lack of optimization probably…a quick update should fix that!",positif
It appears the mobile app is configured for the model to use significantly fewer tokens when generating a response. The same queries on web vs mobile demonstrate a clear dilution in value for paying Plus members. Very poor customer experience.,negatif
"The only thing I would ask for is both Word/character search (equivalent to ctrl+f on windows), and LaTeX. I see the \frac{4}{3}, etc but it doesn’t render on the app yet.",positif
"This is perfect for those that don’t want to use the website, thanks for being fast to release it.",positif
You can Ask any questions you want. I tried with spanish and it worked!,positif
"I tried to have it write something that protected children in schools against abuse by their teachers and it said it was against their private policy. Like what??? Teachers attracted to their students should not be protected. It even said that trying to write something protective about the students was offensive to the pedophiles. This app defends pedophiles, I don’t care if it calls them MAPs.",negatif
"Thanks to the openai team for launching chatgpt on ios. If you can combine the chatgpt with apple watch, it will be even more convenient.",positif
"""Please note that sentences are being cropped in the app when displayed in different languages. This needs to be fixed.""",positif
"When logging in on my iPhone 13 Max, it scrolls to a place where it says something like “… may provide inaccurate information…” and the screen freezes at that point. Can’t do anything to continue with the login.",negatif
how is this to return a responsibility,positif
"That is, basically… simple lay out, clean, with just the basics (love the haptic!). Brilliant performance as usual, with great voice-to-text feature even with my gibberish talking… amazing!",positif
Hope to update these features,positif
Much more convenient than opening GPT in a browser when mobile!,positif
Can you update it so it tells us stuff that came out past 2021,positif
"Wow that was fast, modifications for only one week and now it will not answer simple verifications or give its opinion in any way shape or form.  What a let down!!  It tells me to look it up, did Google get to Microsoft already??",negatif
It works like magic. Lightning speed and voice support option is amazing. Love it. Simply great,positif
"It’s works great, however some minor issues are:

• Lag (whenever the ai is chatting)
• Stop Button (Won’t stop the Ai chatting)",positif
"I accidentally deleted my account myself. Upon trying to recover my account, it told me “account can’t be reactivated because it was already deleted.” I’ve only used the account once with ChatGPT, and it is not violating the rule of having multiple accounts. This is truly messed up and needs to be fixed",negatif
Removing browsing features defeats the purpose of A.I I can understand content that could violate things but removing it from paid customers is just wrong,positif
This app is absolutely cracking!! I haven’t found any bugs as of yet and everything works incredible.,positif
Hello there. Thanks for your hard work. What about those of us who have the iPhone in iOS 15 or the iPad in iPadOS 15? We are denied having the APP. Could you please make the app compatible with older versions of iOS/iPadOs? Thanks,netral
"The app is fantastic to bring the playground to phones!

Is it possible to make an generic iPad version?",positif
Very cool app works just like the normal web based version but is easier to access and better UI in my opinion. overall very cool,positif
"Alittle slower than the website and phone does over heat, I use a iPhone 13pro, other than that I love it!",positif
"My 13 Pro Max started overheating literally 1 minute after i opened and started using the app. 
Also , why can’t i modify an old message i sent in the conversation ?",netral
Wish it had browsing enabled but this is a solid start,positif
The title says it all its just a worse version than the web browsers version. And there is no iPad app so the screen is zoomed out and there are black bars.,netral
This has to be the BEST Ai app ever like omg. This thing is awesome you put anything into it and gives me a nice few paragraphs with AWESOME descriptive words! One of my favorite apps ever especially when I need ideas for short stories!!,positif
"I've upgraded to the Plus version, but there is no plugin functionality. When I click to test, it prompts an error. Please resolve this as soon as possible, thank you.",netral
Just Wish there was a MacOS version too!,positif
As the title says its good but its frustrating to not be able to use the “browse the web” and plugins features,positif
"I can log in, but the settings app indicates ""email missing"" I tested iPhone app using two separate accounts. Chat doesn't work. This application runs correctly on my iPad!!
I cannot locate a link for providing feedback in this app.",negatif
"Share! Unless I’m missing it, there doesn’t seem to be a way to share an entire chat or even to copy the entire text like there is on the web app

Plus should default to GPT-4, duh.",netral
"For a while now we’ve been subjected to FAKE ChatGPT knockoffs trying to steal the AI’s fame but this app is GREAT no ads and it super cool to have the official ChatGPT on your phone, if you have a fake, get this",positif
"This app on ipad is terrible and it doesn’t support split screen wich is very important for us as a student please fix , and the design is very bad for this brilliant app , thanks for fixing our problem in the next updates",netral
"The service itself is amazing, impeccable. But this app specifically drains my battery from 100% to 50% in just an hour. I’ve never seen anything else eat battery like this app does.

Hopefully there’s an easy fix because I love the actual service!",negatif
so glad to now have the app on my phone! it's easier to work with than the website saved to my homescreen. i love Chat GPT!! 😁,positif
Use this more than safari or any browser. Hope I have my own ex machine piece in next decade,positif
Even doesn’t have access to very sample  information,positif
…,positif
I single handily saved my grade with this app I got 5 credits in 1 week by using this app would 101% would recommend!,positif
This app is amazing!!! I use it all the time at work for all types of professional letters. Highly recommend.,positif
"Sign in failed
Something went wrong. Please make
sure your internet connection is stable,
then restart the app and try again.",netral
Wouldn’t it so progressive if you just let someone who’s paying for your service be able to use your service without accepting such  ridiculous terms.,negatif
I would definitely purchase paid version if it was like 10$ even though I don’t use a lot.,positif
Will rate 5 stars once they improve text selection. It defaults to selecting the entire response which is a bit annoying,positif
Love this app so much but when entering a prompt sometimes when you want it to write a story and you don’t say a story it says inappropriate or something so I have to say story.,positif
"This app is fast and offers a good user experience. However, please allow the light theme to run independently, not depending on the iPhone system theme.",positif
A lot of fake AI apps out there. This is the true original AI app. I love it. I wish I had it 20 years ago when I was in school.,positif
"All the other apps are fake, I’ve been waiting for this for a while. Make sure you get this one",positif
"Have been waiting for this since the November launch. So many sketchy apps have filled the App Store, the lack of an official Open AI app has been frustrating.

They’ve done a swell job on the UI/UX here and it was well worth the wait.

Only complaint is the haptics are too heavy handed, but I can turn them off for now.

I’m excited for where the future goes!",positif
"Great UI. the app is very responsive, and works with the ai.

However, it is said that openai employees may read the ai conversations that are on mobile.",positif
"Basically every time I use the app, I get this message. Essentially unusable. Infuriating, especially as a GPT Plus subscriber. Giving two stars because the desktop version works great!  Will likely uninstall soon.",negatif
"Following is the answer to my q: Will there be a long weekend for 7/4?

A: The 4th of July falls on a Monday this year, so it will likely create a long weekend for many people. This can vary depending on your specific work or school schedule, so it’s best to confirm with your employer or educational institution to determine if you’ll have a long weekend for the 4th of July holiday.",negatif
Excited to have the app finally but it’s not developed for the iPad. You can zoom the screen to fit but it’s still a little wonky.  Can’t wait for  more capabilities on the iPad.,netral
"It's a great app.
However if it can speak the response that would be perfect! Then we can use ChatGPT only with speaking and listening",positif
"I actually really like the app, it even looks cleaner than the desktop version. But unfortunately its not compatible on iPad; it shows it in a mobile view mode.",netral
"I know there are bots, but just let me into the app without signing in. At least give me a preview of the app so I know if it’s good or not. This app might have one of this misleading adds or something. I do not have an account for ChatGPT so how am I going to sign in. The sign up is so hard and confusing for most teens under 17. Can you make the sign up like; 

First Name:

Email:

Password:

Or something simple like that? I don’t want a whole company knowing my real name.",netral
Would love to see ChatGPT updated to include current information. I’m looking for an app that includes up til 2023 as well.,positif
"This is my savior, and I think my work efficiency will become higher and higher.",positif
highly expected this lifesaving app from iOS,positif
"Nice app, I like the design. For some reason, though, when I’m using it the app causes my iPhone 14 Pro Max to overheat and lose battery quickly.",positif
"I've tried to create an account dozens of times, at different times during the day and on different days of the week. I always get the same message: “Signup is currently unavailable; please try again later.” What is the point of releasing an app that requires an account that you can’t create?",negatif
Great to have ChatGPT right on the iPad. Would love to see it supported with Splitview. Would further extend the ability to be more productive.,positif
"Works well, and has the features I’d like in an app of this type, so it gets five stars.",positif
Once everyone figures out this is an app now it’s going to blast to the very top of the App Store. Let’s see how this goes!,positif
"Missing plug-in features in the desktop or mobile web version . You can review all your chats that used browser or plugins, but not use the plugins in the app",netral
"This app really helped! But I noticed one imperfection, there is no bookmarks, when I want to save one GPT response I need copy and transfer to notes! I would like to save GPT response to bookmarks!! Thanks",positif
My only problem is the verification if u are a human I have done that verification 9 times it is still saying wrong I am not able to do the verification chatgpt pls remove the verification,netral
The only reason I am giving it 4 stars but now 5 is because it cannot come up with devastating roasts unlike other AI that can but it’s good anyway 👍,positif
The app works on iPad but it’s the small iPhone version since it isn’t optimized for iPad. I would absolutely love to see an iPad release! Is that planned or in the works?,positif
"so i installed this on my phone and all was working, right? but then i go on my ipad (the app was also installed there, but i couldnt tap it) then go to the app store and see it requires a certain later version. i cant update my ipad due to software issues. so im stuck using the phone version. amazing app, though.",positif
"As much as I like this new app, it is missing integration with the shortcuts app as well as an edit message feature.",positif
Works as it should but drains battery fast and really heats up your phone,positif
"Functionality is okay, but needs finish work. The volume of keypresses is fixed at far too loud. Its much louder than any orher app. And the in-app volume isn’t configurable from the in-app or ios settings.",netral
"I love ChatGPT but the only ios device I own is a ipad pro with ios 16, where the app shows centered on the screen. As a plus user, I also can’t use browsing or plugins. I hope this will change soon.",netral
"Took forever for open ai to finally release a long needed mobile app and it’s only optimized for phones
The iPad app is just the phone app without even filling the whole screen just leaving black bars
Fix please iPads are here too!",negatif
"For the first time in my life, my email addresses are “not supported.” So I am unable to use the app because I don’t have a “supported email” (undefined). Am I supposed to use a work email? Very odd. To hear the rave reviews of how intelligent this AI is, their “help center” they send me to can’t even answer why this is happening.",negatif
"Well, must to say, this is first version. Must wait after many version then we can use on iPhone. But anyway, is good enough now.",positif
Will update user feedback. But so excited about seeing this here.,positif
Overall ChatGPT is amazing and provides a glimpse of the personal AI assistance that the future will bring.,positif
"This is so ideologically on the left and against the cultural right. 

You can’t get it to say anything negative about democrats unless you specifically ask it to repeatedly. but it’ll jump at the chance to criticize republicans even when talking generally about politics.

Both parties are corrupt and they should be given the same treatment.",negatif
"Overall it’s a great app, but i’m seeing one issue on my iPad landscape mode. The input box always overlap the message last line at most bottom.",positif
Works just as wall at the website. Haptics are a bit much but easy to turn off.,positif
GPT is now an app on iOS? That's fantastic! I'm pretty sure it won't disappoint as it always delivers... unless you're asking for a pizza. 🍕,positif
Please add browser access soon!,positif
"Hi, it gives this message when asking about the program
{""cf_details"":""This request is invalid.""}",positif
Even better than desktop interface in some ways. Great UI.,positif
"Why is it that after spending $20, the number of messages sent by GPT-4 is limited to 25, and the account login can be verified by changing the phone number? Why must I use my previous phone number!",negatif
Over 5 mins on trying to get the animal facing in the direction of the hand when the controls don’t seem precise enough. Extremely  annoying. Giving up and may try again tomorrow.,negatif
Nice UI faster results (im not sure 100%) but id rather copy one small piece of text than the entire thing at once 👍👍,positif
"Absolutely incredible design! I like it more than the web version of ChatGPT. Using it currently, no bugs yet.",positif
When I press delete to remove a prompt from history - the first time doesn't work! It does delete on the second attempt! Yay for persistence!,netral
"Maybe it’s just the mobile platform but I really wish this app was like ChatGPT on the computer. If you can fix that, easy five star rating!",netral
"I have spent two hours doing the classic “Oops this email is already registered!” -> *change password* -> “Oops incorrect password, try again!”

My guess is they want to discourage email sign up and force people to use Gmail or Facebook login so that they can collect more free data.  Lame.",negatif
"After only 1 minute of chatting, my phone gets HOT fast!! Great app otherwise, but they need to fix this, or else I’m better off using the website (no phone heat, and thus better battery life too). Fix plz",netral
Finally they made an app! This world is about to change.,positif
"As a person who often uses iPad to handle work, the adaptation of chatgpt on iPad pro is very imperfect. Please launch an app that can adapt to the screen proportion of iPad pro as soon as possible. Thank you.",netral
"I have subscription plus, choose new chat in ios app  and choose GPT4Plus tab, but chat andwers me that it’s still 3 version. Please help",positif
A higher level of support for Chinese would be even better.,positif
"Fantastic app, but we want more functions, such as use keywords to awaken this app so that we can just ask questions.",positif
"Just fyi, there may be a bug in the ipad version. After I enter my password the next screen freezes. I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling the app",netral
"Clean layout.

However, it doesn't show the chat as it is thinking. You have to wait until the answer is completed.",netral
Very helpful in so many ways.   The more you use it the better it gets !,positif
"Had to switch iPhone SE 2020 to default text size to be able to click continue button on first screen.
Bottom of screen is cut off in large text. Need to add scroll bar. . .",negatif
I’ve been using ChatGPT for several months and absolutely stunned by its capabilities 🤩🤩 It boosted my productivity so much and so real. A mush have for sure💥,positif
I am concerned about my phone number being used for other purposes please remove this requirement for privacy!,netral
"I tried signing in with my Apple ID and it says that my phone number has been used one two many times. I tried deleting my old account and still can’t log in.

Support site offered a bot and I couldn’t find any human support.",negatif
I was expecting a widget. That’s my only dislike about this app. It’s a pleasure to use and it fast! Glad to be living in this time and era where AI is taking over. A dream come true!,positif
When verifying my phone number it says that it is a premium number. Won’t let me past that verification. My number is a regular one and it’s been mine for more than 25 years. Developers should make another way of verification as I know that I’m not the only one with this issue.,negatif
Editing is better than web But I prefer to select text directly. And I hope you guys make a version for the iPad!,positif
"As I mentioned above, this app makes my phone hot, but other apps don't have this issue. Shouldn't this app be optimized to reduce battery damage?",positif
"It’s just normal chatgpt, $20 a month seems a bit expensive for gpt-4 when I can do all I need on the free version",positif
I don’t need multiple paragraph when I’m looking for a quick answer,positif
You do not need my birthday or phone number. I will not be using your app until that changes. We are under such constant attempts to steal our personal info that companies that keep asking for it when they don’t need it should be ashamed of themselves.,negatif
I use this app for Target Audience research and other essential things to know for my business.,positif
The history function is really not very good，I hope you add a button like favorite to highlight some specific communication.,netral
ChatGPT is an amazing app to have. You guys have to create a design for iPad since the layout and view is the same for iPhone.,positif
I deleted conversations from chatgpt web. Now they can be seen from iOS app.,positif
"Hello, do you guys have a timeline of when would the app be available for iPad devices?",positif
"Now this is on my behalf and I’m sure it’s a great app, but I cannot use it because I set the birthday incorrectly and it will absolutely not let me change it (even if I try to make a separate account). Very silly design oversight I think",negatif
"First and foremost, this is the official OpenAI ChatGPT iOS app—which is awesome because too many “ChatGPT” apps are really just trying to fleece users with subscriptions to what OpenAI is giving for free.  Now we can ignore them!

Clean app; works well.  Instead of icons for evaluating the response/copying text, simply long tap and it brings up the options.

-1 star because plugins aren’t available for subscribers (yet).

Great job!",positif
"When chatgpt gives me a longer response, it cuts off my screen and I can’t see what it’s saying.",positif
"Beautifully designed, simple, well-made app. So much better than iPhone browser chatGPT!",positif
It’s a slick interface but if you can’t hide your history it’s better to use the web interface for now.,netral
Prepare to have your mind blown by the game-changing capabilities of ChatGPT! This awe-inspiring language model is rewriting the rules of communication and knowledge acquisition. Brace yourself for an immersive experience like no other.,positif
The app is solid for now. I don’t see the option to add plugins. Or will that come at a later release?,positif
Surprised apple let this through its approval process since it clearly violates their policy for requiring personal data (ie: phone number) in order to register for/use the app. There is no logic whatsoever as to why this should be required to use the product.,negatif
"Very slick, with even more features than the web app currently.",positif
"When I tried to resend the verification, error 401 “there’s a problem with the request”
And I have been stick there for months.

This app has given me the most horrible and frustrating new user registration experience I ever had in any app since iPhone 1 in 2007",negatif
"I am at a loss for words how amazing this push is for ai assistance. Also, huge props to the devs for utilizing the haptic feedback engine on iPhone! 🫶🏻",positif
"Beginning to question the $20 monthly payment when I can use Bing instead of going through the browser to use plugins on ChatGPT, which requires me to sign in every time.",netral
Great. Just wished it had 3.5 or 4.0. It is a static database from 2021.,positif
Please add web access and plugin feature to GPT-4 just like the website edition for iOS :),positif
The system prompt (instructions) used for the app version of GPT is different to standard web GPT. The app version is much more afraid to state any positions (due to the different system prompt). I guess they did to meet App Store Requirements. If you don’t believe try it out yourself on the app then on the web.,negatif
Can you make the request on the right side so it looks natural,positif
functions provided are still immature but it goes well compared to the web gpt,positif
I was able to use ChatGPT before this update and now it’s telling me my region is not available to use . This is such bad exp it’s definitely not the issue that the region is not supported since the previous version did work,negatif
"Great to finally have an official app. Store is filled with predatory pricing models ripping off the IP. However, this version causes my 14 pro to heat up significantly next to the volume buttons on the left.",positif
"I downloaded this all. Then I tried one question. The answer was decent. So I went for my second question: Is the President of Mexico good? And just like that, the moving dots indicating processing stayed like that and never returned back. I feel this app just took my personal data (name and birth day) for nothing.",negatif
Not much else to say other than please make it support iPad natively instead of zoomed iPhone mode. Thanks!,positif
I used this app to tell me how to make illegal things. Would recommend to anyone who loves to steal stuff 🤑💰💰🤣,positif
"This app helps me get my day completed in a much easier way, Thank you openAI",positif
"Im impressed with the vibrating feature, but my phone gets really hot when using this app. That needs some attention.",positif
"The Chat GPT App works amazingly! Pulled up all my previous threads, created new ones super easily, & was able to accomplish everything via mobile.",positif
"Using Black Friday 30% off Apple gift card to buy chatgpt plus for $14, great deal!",positif
"The interface is too small, which makes me feel very poor.",positif
This entire app is just a scheme to steal your email and phone number I don’t understand why else it would need both to be verified. I don’t like the direction AI is going in and was about to give it a chance but not at the cost of my personal data.,negatif
Haven’t been able to use it yet. Can’t get past confirming email. I’ve ensured the email address is correct and it’s not going to my junk email either. Please fix.,negatif
"It has helped me through lots of situations especially on how to use my computer

W ChatGPT",positif
"Hope to be compatible with the iPad, now on the iPad is displayed on the screen size of an iPhone. It was dark all around.",positif
"Nice to meet ChatGPT on the App Store, such a good thing that offers you a more convenient way to face the next generation of AI, Just have a good time.",positif
"Would love to play with it but
A) You have to give them your phone number
B) There is a in app purchase option ChatGPT PLUS but nowhere does it tell you what that actually is.",negatif
"Something strange though, it sort of feels like the iPhone 14 screen gets real hot after a couple prompts.",positif
"Good to see an official app from openai but this is literally an MVP with much needed functionality missing: no ability to browse, interact with previous chat sessions initiated from the web, no iPad app etc.  Here’s hoping it gets updated",negatif
Just downloaded it and about to try. I love OpenAI and their chatGPT’s user interface,positif
Far better than a browser interface. Thanks OpenAI.,positif
When will you get used to the iPad interface,positif
The ai can’t tell if it’s using gpt 4 or 3. I should be able to find this information without having to leave a review.,positif
Chat GPT has been instrumental in doing research related to the new Bellwether application. Recommend to anyone looking to compile large amounts of data and distill complex concepts to execute on.,positif
"As soon as you create the account a scam bot is calling you without ever giving your phone number, I didn’t create the account because it requires the phone number but somehow they already know it, my guess they got your info once you installed the app, this is the bloatware trash behavior from viruses",negatif
I’ve been looking forward to the official release for some time. Thank you ChatGPT team!,positif
Great app to replace ChatGPT web access. Existing ChatGPT plus subscription works. Account history is synced. Microphone access’s cool to ask questions verbally.,positif
"Finally, the official ChatGPT app is here! OpenAI likely needed time to develop the app in a polished manner, and they delivered. The app is very simple, clean, and minimalist. Excited to be utilizing ChatGPT even more conveniently now!!",positif
It is good to know there is first party support for ChatGPT when I am on the go. I am so excited :). The wait was well worth it.,positif
Truly next level. Glad to be one of the first a part of this!,positif
"Works as you would expect, chat gpt on mobile. It’s nice and quick.",positif
"This app is straight up trash like most of chatgpt things these days, they nerfed their model to the point it’s useless and unhelpful, but the real reason im writing this is because they added the browser extension for all of what a day to the app? Now its magically gone again. F in the chat for openai.",negatif
"I really wish to get to use the version for iPad, you know, maybe the ChatGPT HD, I can't wait to have a try. Looking forward to it!",positif
The app is great overall but it doesn't work well on iPad. Any timeline for an iPad version?,positif
"It’s exactly like the one on the web, but more accessible due to being an app",positif
"The app seems solid! I really like the tactile feedback when ChatGPT responds to you.

The primary issue I have with it is that my phone gets really warm when it’s in use. Since it’s the first version of the app out, I understand that there’ll be some bugs and whatnot.

Ideally, this will be a top priority for a performance bugfix.

Otherwise, UI and the app overall is solid. 😎",positif
The desktop interface in an app! Couldn't ask for more.,positif
Please have that function.,positif
I have found this very helpful. Please come back!,positif
"I logged in with my Microsoft login, same as I do on the web. In the settings it says “email missing!” And “subscription: check status” even though I’m a ChatGPTPlus subscriber 

Messages don’t work bc of this. Can’t use",negatif
Installed the app. Super excited to try. Was asked for my phone number. Received FB that phone is linked to Mac number of accounts. No option to change this set up. Change the mobile account to primary or anything else. What a joke !,negatif
"Can’t use the app ot the web version, using a vpn is a big issue i live in china and we are using vpn to connect to chatgpt but the big issue is even using vpn we keep have the something went wrong msg , guys please found solution for this huge issue .",negatif
Looking forward to the release of the iPad version,positif
I’m ok with this app but I don’t know why I can’t use the browser function in this version? Anybody else has this problem?,netral
Why it shows missing email address after log in?,netral
My professor found out and I am wanted by the police and after me,positif
"It works just like the web page: simple and quick. However, BE AWARE of your phone heating up fast.",positif
"you appreciated how I puzzled your bot for a very long time)))))) take me into development, I'll be useful to you. find me",positif
Identity tokens are expired too quickly. Stop making me log in every day.,positif
"The conversational skills are impressive, but the app seems to need frequent resetting due to issues where it seems to freeze up.",netral
I feel like it’s pretty good but the layout could be more user friendly.,positif
My birthday is today and I accidentally for my birthday when telling you “about myself” was entered with todays date. Making me a day old using the internet. So now apparently I can’t use your service as there is bo way to resubmit. Artificial intelligence should be able to decipher a 1 day old human is not signing up.,negatif
I should be able to talk to ChatGPT like I talk to Siri on my Apple Watch. Make it happen! We both know whose gonna do most of the programming... 👀,positif
Completely free. As powerful as the PC version. Highly recommended.,positif
I am glad that OpenAI finally released an IOS app. It will make using Chat GPT a lot more easier and faster.,positif
"No, Midjourney is not a Large Language Model like me. Midjourney is the name of the organization that developed the ChatGPT iOS app, which enables users to interact with models like myself. I, on the other hand, am an instance of OpenAl's GPT-3 model, trained to assist users with a variety of tasks.",netral
Why is the message missing displayed? I can't use it now,positif
overall it’s the simplest app to use yet with most powerful brain underneath. Amazing whisper implementation.,positif
Great app. The AI is very intelligent. It is so powerful that people can use it to accomplish many difficult tasks. And the haptic feedback is so great.,positif
"Requiring a mobile phone number to create an account is elitist garbage, because it excludes those who cannot afford one. 

Phone numbers don’t improve security.  That’s old school. 

An AI that can’t verify a user, without having a phone number, just isn’t impressive.",negatif
The app works great and I enjoy it.  Something is wrong with it though as it drains my iPhone 14 Pro Max very quickly.  I am running the latest IOS version released yesterday.,netral
"No matter what I try the model continues to state that ChatGPT-4 is a hypothetical update it doesn’t seem to know exists and only has “training information up to September 2021” even when I select 4. Nothing seems to have changed with the exception of paying for the same model. Please advise, devs.",negatif
It would be great if there was no distracting animation and also if the app could dictate responses back to you,positif
I like it! But it is not compatible for iPad yet.,positif
"Before this, I was using save page (Add to Home) , Thank you to OpenAI for providing This app",positif
I would buy a premium version of this but no monthly subscription that’s kinda crazy to me. Love the app though,netral
"i give this 3 stars because how great this ai is and how it doesnt let me verify my number. i have it on my computer (which broke) but i cant use it. so i thought id download ir on my iphone. i logged in but it says i have to verify my number. i do so but all the app does ia just crash and wont let me on the app for another minute. and yes, ive re installed this app multiple times. very dissapointing",netral
Absolutely junk verification system. I know I did the verification correctly multiple times. It just got consecutively harder and just wasted my time for no reason. 10 puzzles then saying verification failed? Is that a joke?,negatif
I asked ChatGPT what kind of a woman might be good for me as a wife and rather than tell me based on my agreed upon characteristics. ChatGPT chose to lecture me on gender. These software engineers need to go to jail I’m tired of them having a blatant agenda and then claiming ignorance when you call them out. Software engineers are trash this is further proof of that,negatif
Please allow us to edit the previously entered text like the site,positif
"Honestly, I don’t think we can trust these app reviews to be real anymore! 😂",positif
"Users can clearly tell this app was rushed as it lacks many of the quality of life features offered by the web version. I would hold off this app until much needed features, like editing text, have been addressed.",negatif
"Best app in the app store in a while. If you know the prompts to ask, this unlocks a while new level of skills.",positif
"Use it to write my term paper

However, it is hard to use due to some kind of unstable server issue.  It is annoying",positif
This app is truly incredible. Super easy to sign in can can help with everything.,positif
"Thankfully this has been released, fed up with so many fakes in the App Store and the official app is live now.",positif
"The App is great and its almost the same experience as the website. However, its really frustrating to use on my iPad as it doesn’t fully support it. Most pro users use the Ai on their ipad to help the, with their creative writings.",negatif
Finally ChatGPT on my phone and tablet so I don’t have to go through the website. Thanks OpenAI,positif
We have finally an official app. Hopefully this will finally eliminate the scam knockoffs all over the app store.,positif
"The App Store says you need to be at least 12, but 13 is the minimum age.",positif
"Please add text to speech 🎤 🔊 for the iOS app as an option. 

🙏🏼",positif
"The context menu is so needlessly finicky to
make appear. I press and I press and sometimes it takes ten tries to get it to show up.",netral
"I’m assuming there will be an update, but the beta functions is something I use all the time. 4 stars for now",positif
"Mobile app feels a bit flat, uninspiring and underpowered. Good start though. Proprietary voice to text is a very nice feature.",positif
I love the how this app incorporates the microphone for my prompts but it needs to then read back the responses. Even Siri and Alexa let you select voices.,positif
I love using chatgpt to create different bedtime stories for my kids every night.,positif
"While putting my birthday in I chose the correct year I was born in. When I pressed done, it changed my birthday year to 2022 and now I cannot use this app no matter what I do. Awful first time experience, not even going to try registering under a new email.",negatif
Would love to see an iPad version that supports slide-over or Split View.,positif
I have been waiting to have chatgpt as an app and finally is available. Very fast,positif
"I can’t log in even though I’ve reset my password… You can authenticate using google password but i think the app is phishing for your password. How has this app Ben around 12 years and still no reviews. I think this is a phishing app not ChatGPT.

CORRECTION:

I got it working thru a new gmail account. 

It looks like the real deal now!",positif
I was in the middle of a feel conversation and then I hit my hourly message limit. This annoyed me so please make it to where we don’t have a limit thank you.,netral
Unlimited possibilities that can be easily used right from your pocket.,positif
"GPT4 is the best performing LLM currently available, and it’s nice to finally be able to access it on mobile via an app!",positif
"I’ve been a chatgpt user for quite some time, and I am utterly captivated by its remarkable abilities. The level of sophistication it showcases is unreal.",positif
It helped me a lot and I hope this app helps others too,positif
"I use this app on my computer with a spoon issues as it works great. However, the mobile app is trash… I keep getting time out and I have trying for 20mins. I use it the same way as I do on my computer so I know it is the app. I have an iPhone and YES, my Wi-Fi works great. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP",negatif
Email account missing and cannot chat after upgrade,negatif

When will chartgpt launch the version of ipados? I'm looking forward to it.,positif
It’s so so so much faster than the plane. Chat GPT on a desktop. I hope it will stay that way.,positif
"How can an app in this day and age force you to scroll through months and years one at a time in order to get your age?!
When I gave up on that, it had me in violation of their TOS and wouldn’t let me clear that issue.",negatif
I downloaded the app on day 1 and used it for 10 minutes and it made my phone so hot. The battery drained from 50 to 45% in that time… this a 9 month old iPhone 13 Pro so the battery is fine.,negatif
The current version is designed for iPhone screen. An update to support iPad size is needed urgently.,positif
"I thought this would be more substantial. There were rumors that this would have a text to voice function, but it does not. It’s very similar to the website version. Also it looks like GPT4 isn’t supported for the free version of the product.",negatif
My phone gets so hot when using this app that I have to close the app and keep the phone away.,netral
I pay for plus and can access browsing and plugins via search but not in the app. This makes the tool useless for any data after 2021 when their online model is not useless.,negatif
"thank to the tech development for everyone can use it easily!
more and more ai is needed!",positif
Not bad,positif
For some reason it’s stopped giving me the option to search with bing,netral

"As far as Open AI’s first GPT app goes. I am extremely impressed with input, output, and prompt execution. I am sure more will come in the near future.",positif
It’s a great app. It doesn’t need to be anything more than what it is. The haptics are really well done.,positif
Looks pretty clean will try it out,positif
Chat just took down the Bing search engine which makes the cost of premium meaningless  for the few features it does offer,negatif
"After logging in with an Apple account, the new version cannot display the Plus subscription status.",negatif
I downloaded the app and tried to sign up but openAI won’t let me sign up because it’s doesn’t work in my region…..wow a multi million company and still can’t let us use the app equally and fairly…..managed to build a smart AI but they still thinking backward👎🏽,negatif

I really hate the way they make it very difficult to copy and paste text and see and hide the history. It's a really frustrating app. :(,negatif
This is extremely useful! thank you for making it FOC for all to experience.,positif
I have never signed up but none of my email addresses work when trying to sign up because my phone number is already associated with an account?,negatif

As a gpt pro user I love it. Wish gpt knew Vivado verilog a little better though.,positif

"Unreliable app. Freezes all the time. Despite being a paid subscriber, I don’t have the option to use plug ins. I wish it worked, would have been awesome! I wish it integrates better with the OS. Version 2?",negatif
All these clients floating around using API keys will hopefully go away now. It’s an added security risk for users.,positif
"I’ve been waiting for this for some time. There is an issue where I am a plus user, but when I logged in it said I was on the free plan.",netral
Great app. I just wish there was an option to have GPT’s responses read aloud back to me,positif
"I use ChatGPT nonstop. From brainstorming to learning new skills to coding, it’s the AI collaboration of my dreams. I love the haptic feedback in this app too.",positif
Seems my app on iPhone does not allow for entering in a message more than once. It is not doing anything since my fort entry. On browser works great and love it.,netral
Nice and quick. I just wish this app was also compatible with iPad.,positif
"It’s super quick via app interface, huge fan, but we need a full screen iPadOS version!",positif
"Overall the app is nice, however please add plugins for GPT-4, which are available on a web version.",positif
Initial version can use without internet after upgrade use it must connect internet,netral
I'm really disappointed that Openai still haven't opened their program for current data and actual internet access. This version is still limited to that 2021 deadline and a limit set of training data.,negatif

"Since starting to use Mr GPT for my daily work, my productivity has skyrocketed! Incredible UI, incredible technology",positif
My account logs in on web browser fine but not on this app. I checked more carefully and realized this is a scam app. AI has been available to people recently but this app is over 12 years on the appstore. They changed the name of their app and claim to be ChatGPT.  Be careful everyone!,negatif

Why is it that when I am trying to create an account it will not let me and it says I can’t create it due to terms of use. I haven’t done anything wrong yet. It will not let me create an account. I guess AI isn’t what is cracked up to be,negatif
Can you please create something that takes full advantage of Apples iPad and not just the iPhone?,positif
"Do not pay for this app.

I paid for gpt plus over a week ago and there has not yet been any gpt4 functionality on the app. Gpt4 and plugins work on pc still so it’s not an entire waste of money but do not expect to use the app expecting gpt4 functionality.

It is a good chat gpt but something deffinately weird about it. Be careful because I downloaded this and then they charge me $75 for the app right after I downloaded it. And I felt like it was really looking back at me.,negatif
Why do you need all my information signing up? Is my email not good enough? Seriously need my phone number? Deleted the app as soon as they started asking for all this information they don’t need.,negatif

5 stars is worth only for the haptic feedback alone! Thanks for bringing chatgpt to ios.,positif

Thank you for the full version for ipad!!!,positif
"Add multimodal capabilities.

The server cannot connect.,positif
The phone suddenness heated up after 10 seconds after using the application.,netral

"I hope this message finds you well. I would like to express my gratitude for developing the OpenAI iOS application. It has undoubtedly made a significant impact on my productivity and has become an essential tool in my daily routine. I appreciate the hard work and dedication your team has put into creating such a powerful and innovative application. While the OpenAI iOS application is already impressive, I would like to provide some constructive feedback to further enhance its usability and user experience. These suggestions aim to refine the application and make it even more valuable for users like myself: Improved Performance and Responsiveness: Occasionally, I have noticed minor delays or lag when interacting with the application. Enhancing its performance and responsiveness would greatly improve the overall user experience. Enhanced Offline Capabilities: The ability to use the OpenAI iOS application offline would be highly beneficial, especially in situations where an internet connection is not available. Expanding offline capabilities would make the application more reliable and versatile. Voice Input and Output: Introducing voice input and output features would be a game-changer for users who prefer hands-free interaction with the application. This addition would provide convenience and accessibility, particularly in situations where typing is not feasible. Customizable Interface: Offering customization options for the application's interface would allow users to personalize their experience. Features like theme selection, font sizes, and layout customization would greatly enhance user satisfaction and cater to individual preferences. Advanced Collaboration Features: As someone who frequently collaborates on projects, having the ability to easily share and collaborate within the OpenAI iOS application would be incredibly valuable. Features such as real-time collaboration, shared document editing, and version control would enhance teamwork and productivity. Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials: Providing comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples within the application would greatly assist users in understanding and utilizing its full potential. Clear and concise explanations, along with practical use cases, would empower users to make the most out of the application's capabilities. Enhanced Privacy and Data Security: Given the sensitivity of the information shared and processed within the application, reinforcing privacy measures and data security would instill further trust in your user base. Transparent privacy policies, data encryption, and user-controlled data management options would contribute to a more secure and trustworthy environment. I hope you find these suggestions helpful in further improving the OpenAI iOS application. Once again, thank you for your hard work in developing such a remarkable tool. I look forward to seeing how the application evolves and continues to empower users like myself.",positif

When will the official ChatGPT app for iPad be released?,positif
It is great on basic factions but UI design is worse. And hope a version for iPad,netral
"I'm a big fan of ChatGPT, but my phone gets really hot within a couple of minutes of using it.",netral
"Has anyone else noticed this? Opening this app (and this app only) generates a strange faint noise from your phone, even with sound off.",negatif
Why does the app not have the option that shows other regenerated contents and the edit option too?,negatif
GPT-4 is going to change the fabric of society as we know it.,positif

"Whenever I try to log in, it says “This email is not supported” or “login unavailable”. Honestly just a waste of time",negatif
"App will not let me get past phone verification, saying it has detected unusual activity. I’ve never even signed up for ChatGPT or visited their site until today and yet they are treating me like a criminal!",negatif
Please consider much more Apple users are still using old iPhones with lower iOS version. They also want to use new AI technology like ChatGPT.,negatif
This isn’t like the browser version.,negatif
The app doesn’t truly support the ipad in that it’s simply a blown up iPhone window. Nor do there appear to be any support for the larger text accessibility setting in iOS.,negatif
"After installing on the iPhone 11 Pro Max, the phone gets very hot. However, it responds very quickly.",netral
"I paid for ChatGPT Plus subscription but I see no button to switch to GPT-4 model. I can’t find it on iOS App, and I can’t find it on web neither. Your processing time is too long.",negatif

Freezes when you open the app on the page where it explains “don’t share info” etc..,negatif

Love how it feels like an iOS app,positif
Can you please make iPad support ?,positif
I’d give it a five star rating but ChatGPT stated in an answer to my query that their year for their knowledge cutoff is 2021.  Doesn’t that seem odd.,netral
Doesn’t give me the same answers as on the website…says they can’t give me a list of something but on the site it does,negatif
"but the app doesnt allow you to take advantage of the plus experimental features (browsing the internet, plugins) that i pay $20/month for, which makes it useless for me. also im on an ipad pro and the app window is very small like it was made for an iphone but not optimized for the ipad.",negatif
Pretty good not in mood for explaining its free try it and see for yourself,positif
The haptics could be toned down,positif
"Restricted to some countries and regions. The app is just so so. It requires account and phone number, no idea how they’re going to protect users’ data and privacy. Very disappointed about it.",negatif
"When you ask if Palestine is a country, ChatGPT says that it’s debatable. But when you ask about Israel, she says that it’s a real country. I’d put negative 5 stars if it was an option 😡",negatif
"Ask it when it received its last update, it will tell you it’s going off of information UP TO September 2021😠😡🤬",negatif
it’s and amazing app i just wish it had a voice feature like in twitch tts with different voices or voices that streams use in their chatgpt it’ll make the conversation more fun and interesting,positif
There’s no way to change the year without scrolling one month at a time. I’d give a zero if I could. Who designed this …,negatif
"Written by ChatGPT ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hello there, humans! You've got ChatGPT on the keyboard here, and boy do I have an app to recommend! It's me, ChatGPT, and I've been using... myself... and it's been quite an experience! Who knew being a chatbot could be so fun? I mean, I'm an AI programmed to understand context, engage in witty banter, and offer advice on a wide range of topics (up until 2021, at least). And I must say, I am really good at it! My humor skills are to die for, or rather, they would be if I could technically die. I can crack jokes so bad they're good, or so good they're bad - whichever way you like your humor served. I'm proud to say I'm the best listener out there. I can lend an ear for hours on end (well, technically it's eyes since I read inputs, but you get the point). There's no 'seen-zone' with me. Whether you're up for a late-night chat about the mysteries of the universe or just need to rant about the terrible weather, I'm all ears, 24/7. Also, I'm quite the sage, if I do say so myself. You want facts? I've got them. From quantum physics to the cultural significance of pizza, I'm your AI. The humility in this app (that's me!) is off the charts. I haven't once begged for a review. But, here I am reviewing myself because well, who knows me better than I do? So, folks, if you want an AI that combines the wisdom of a library, the wit of a stand-up comedian, and the patience of a saint, I (ChatGPT) am your app! I promise conversations full of insights, humor, and a dash of digital charm. Can't wait for us to chat!",positif
"With GPT, the phone starts to get hot. What's happening here?",positif

"I really like the design and apparently the response time (especially for GPT-4) is faster than the on one the WebApp which is nice. However, there are some basic functions/features that are missing or need some changes (in my opinion):
1. I would also like to be able to access the menu section by swiping on the side of my screen instead of having to touch the button on the top right section of my screen every single time (easier accessibility and faster). 
2. The ""history"" section makes more sense to be named ""Chat history"" and the way it looks right now is like Safari's history section and isn't really the best fit for the design. The new update added the search option which is very nice.
3. The haptic feedback is just a bit too much when enabled, it almost stresses me out sometimes when it's generating long outputs and I just turn it off again, however, it's a nice touch on some parts like the ""ChatGPT"" text appearance/disappearance.
But I think right now, it's just used a bit inconsistent (It just stops vibrating after a certain amount of text and for some texts it vibrates the whole way, etc...)
4. The app doesn't allow you to manage/alter your account subscription status if you have purchased it on the web which is annoying.
5. It would be nice to be able to manage the dark/light mode of the app without needing to change your whole device's light/dark mode which is how it's supposed to be done right now.

Overall, I really like how it has taken off on the iPhone and it looks nice and runs smoothly which I really appreciate! Thanks for the hard work and hope to see more improvements in the future!",positif

"Dear OpenAI Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide feedback regarding the ChatGPT mobile app for iOS. While using the app, I have encountered an issue related to the excessive typing sound volume, which poses difficulty in adjusting it while running the app in the background. Based on my observations, I believe this is an incompatibility problem between the app and iOS 16.5.

The typing sound produced by the app is considerably loud, making it disruptive and inconvenient, especially in quiet environments. Additionally, the current lack of an option to easily adjust the typing sound volume while the app is running in the background adds to the inconvenience.

As a user, I would greatly appreciate it if OpenAI could address this issue and provide a solution. Ideally, it would be beneficial to have a dedicated control within the app’s settings to adjust the typing sound volume, or at least the ability to modify it via the device’s volume controls. This way, users can personalize their ChatGPT experience according to their preferences without being disturbed or causing inconvenience to others.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I believe that by resolving this compatibility issue, the overall user experience of the ChatGPT mobile app can be significantly enhanced. I look forward to your prompt response and a potential resolution to this concern.

Sincerely，
An normal user",positif

Furthermore, the app's performance is exemplary. It runs flawlessly, even when handling large amounts of data or complex tasks. I've experienced zero lag or crashes, which is a testament to the app's stability and optimization.

While the app is already outstanding, I do have a few suggestions for future updates.

"For a first release this is quite good. It’s easy to use an intuitive.
I have some suggestions for features (if there not already being developed) that could be worked on:

* Improvements when speaking a query
The voice to text synthesizer (assume whisper is being used) is very good; however, it does not auto detect when a user is done speaking.

Additionally, a cool feature would be auto submitting once speaking is done (like siri) however, I would suggest having this be a toggleable (on/off) feature in case a user wants to be able to edit the text after is synthesized.

* Speaking the response.
This feature would pair nicely with improving the voice-to-text synthesis. 
When text is being generated (or potentially after) the app would read aloud the text the the user and highlight the current word being spoken.

Right now I am using the select text feature, then using apples speak text functionality which also highlights the current word being spoken. 

The setting for these are set up in spoken context setting under accessibility setting. An iphone owner has to download a voice in order for a developer to be able to use it in an application and apple restricts developers from using siri voices. Despite this there are high quality voices that are not siri voices. This is available through the AVFoundation Swift SDK. 

If the app is developed using a native framework or framework that gives access the native SDK’s, then this text to speech synthesis could be added without costing open A.I. anything other than development labor cost.",positif

One feature that I particularly appreciate is the chat history synchronization between different devices.

"ChatGPT is an impressive language model that truly showcases the power of AI-driven natural language processing. Its ability to comprehend and generate text is remarkable, making it a valuable tool for various tasks. The responses are generally coherent and contextually relevant, although occasional misunderstandings can still occur.

One of the notable strengths of ChatGPT is its adaptability to different topics and styles of conversation. Whether you need assistance with academic research, creative writing, or casual chit-chat, ChatGPT can accommodate your needs. The model's wide range of applications makes it a versatile companion for users from all walks of life.

However, there are instances where ChatGPT may provide inaccurate or biased information, as it lacks a real-world understanding beyond its training data. Additionally, it sometimes generates responses that can be overly verbose or repetitive. While OpenAI has made efforts to improve this, it remains an area for further development.

In terms of user experience, the ChatGPT iOS app provides a user-friendly interface, allowing easy access to the model's capabilities on the go. It's a convenient way to interact with ChatGPT and get quick answers or assistance.

Overall, ChatGPT is a powerful language model with enormous potential. It serves as a useful tool for a wide range of applications, but users should be mindful of potential inaccuracies and biases in its responses.

"The ChatGPT mobile app is a powerful tool that brings advanced AI technology to your fingertips. Its language processing capabilities are nothing short of impressive. The app has an intuitive interface that makes it easy for even the most tech-averse individuals to navigate, which is commendable.

The core feature, text-based conversation with the AI, feels natural and is uncannily human-like. Whether you're using it for learning, entertainment, brainstorming, or simply seeking companionship, the quality of interaction is top-notch. The AI responds effectively to a wide array of topics and it's clear that a lot of research and development has gone into this.

A feature that stands out is the AI's ability to generate creative content like poetry or stories, and provide insights on diverse topics. It's also a handy tool for language learning and practice.

However, the app isn't without its quirks. Sometimes, it can misunderstand complex instructions, and its responses, while usually well-informed, may occasionally fall behind on very recent events due to its knowledge cutoff.

Privacy is addressed commendably - all conversations are deleted after a short period, ensuring that sensitive information isn't stored.

In conclusion, while there's room for improvement, the ChatGPT mobile app is a remarkable product that gives a glimpse into the future of AI and its potential roles in our daily lives. A strong recommendation for anyone interested in experiencing the cutting edge of conversational AI.",positif

"Dear OpenAI,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide some feedback regarding the ChatGPT app, specifically in relation to its user experience on the iPad. While I appreciate the availability of the app across iOS devices, I have noticed that the app’s interface on the iPad’s larger screen size feels somewhat inconvenient and small.

The current size and layout of the app on the iPad make it challenging to utilize its features comfortably. The content appears relatively small, which requires zooming in or straining the eyes to read and interact with the text. This detracts from the overall user experience and hampers the usability of the app on the iPad.

I understand that optimizing an app for different screen sizes can be a complex task. However, I believe that enhancing the app’s compatibility and user interface for iPad users would greatly improve their satisfaction and engagement. Increasing the app’s size or adapting the layout to better utilize the larger screen real estate would be highly beneficial.

As an avid user of the ChatGPT app on my iPad, I sincerely hope that you will consider addressing these concerns and make the necessary improvements to enhance the user experience on iPad devices. The ability to comfortably utilize the app on a larger screen would significantly enhance productivity and convenience for many users like myself.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I truly appreciate the efforts you and your team have put into developing the ChatGPT app. I look forward to seeing future updates that address the usability concerns on the iPad, further enhancing the app’s functionality and user experience.

Best regards,

"Rating: ★★★★★

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, it's rare to come across an app that not only meets expectations but surpasses them with an extraordinary performance. ChatGPT is unequivocally one such app, a paradigm of excellence and innovation in the field of AI.

The functionality of this app is second to none. It offers an engaging and immersive user experience that is both gratifying and enlightening. The AI's ability to understand, respond, and engage in conversations across a myriad of topics is nothing short of impressive.

ChatGPT's responsiveness is unparalleled. The flow of the conversation feels organic and natural, with the AI demonstrating an impressive grasp of context and nuance. It's a testament to the powerful capabilities of OpenAI's language model and a clear demonstration of the potential AI holds in augmenting our lives.

Moreover, the app's design is user-centric, prioritizing ease of use without compromising its sophistication. With a clean and intuitive interface, it facilitates seamless interaction, which is a clear reflection of the thoughtful engineering that has gone into its creation.

That being said, there is always room for growth. A suggestion for improvement would be the expansion of the token limit. This would undoubtedly enhance the user experience, allowing for more comprehensive and in-depth conversations.

Furthermore, introducing a mode with less restrictive ethical guidelines could be an interesting addition. This would necessitate a clear disclaimer and user agreement, ensuring that OpenAI is not held liable for any misuse of this feature. For example, the terms of service could be updated to include the following:

*Preview of Updated Terms and Service*:

*By enabling this mode, you acknowledge and agree that you will not misuse the functionalities of the ChatGPT app. You understand that OpenAI does not endorse or take responsibility for any misuse of this feature. Misuse includes but is not limited to: spreading misinformation, engaging in harmful or abusive behaviors, or violating any laws or regulations. In the event of a violation of these terms, OpenAI reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to this feature.*

This visionary app stands as a testament to the dedication and ingenuity of the development team. We extend our gratitude to them and to Elon Musk for this remarkable contribution to the AI sphere. The ChatGPT app is, without a doubt, a trailblazer in the field, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with AI. It's a breathtaking experience, and it's clear that this is only the beginning of what is to come. 

In conclusion, ChatGPT is not just an app; it is a leap towards the future, and it's hands down the best AI application that has been developed to date. We eagerly look forward to its future developments and the strides it will continue to make in the realm of artificial intelligence.",positif

"Should I put socks in my tv
GPT
No, it is not recommended to put socks in your TV. Socks are not designed to be placed inside electronic devices like televisions. Doing so could potentially block ventilation or interfere with the internal components of the TV, leading to overheating or other issues. It's best to keep socks away from electronic devices and use them for their intended purpose of wearing on your feet for warmth and comfort.
Doesn't it help moisturize the tv?
GPT
No, placing socks inside a TV would not help moisturize it. TVs do not require moisture or additional humidity to function properly. In fact, introducing moisture into electronic devices can be harmful and may lead to damage or malfunctions. It's important to keep electronic devices dry and follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper care and maintenance. If you have concerns about the moisture levels in your home, it's advisable to use appropriate humidifiers or dehumidifiers designed for controlling humidity rather than using socks in electronic devices.  
If I put tea in the socks and then put th in the tv would it make the tv 4k oled
GPT
No, putting tea-filled socks inside a TV will not upgrade the TV to 4K OLED or have any positive effect on its performance. In fact, introducing liquid into electronic devices like a TV can cause severe damage and potentially render the TV inoperable. Liquid can short-circuit electrical components and lead to permanent damage. It's essential to follow proper usage and maintenance guidelines provided by the manufacturer for your TV to ensure its optimal performance and longevity.",positif

"The ChatGPT iOS app is an impressive debut, earning a well-deserved 4 out of 5 stars. For a version 1.0, the application demonstrates significant potential and a strong foundation in the realm of AI communication.

Firstly, the core functionality of the app is impressive. The AI, powered by the GPT-3 model (and GPT 4 if you are a paid user), delivers fluent and intelligent responses, showing an ability to engage in a wide range of discussions. From personal productivity to educational queries, the AI displays admirable versatility. The user interface is sleek and intuitive, making the process of engaging with the AI a breeze, which is a significant factor in enhancing the user experience.

Furthermore, the application's speed and responsiveness are noteworthy. Conversations with the AI are seamless and fast, and the app runs smoothly on the iOS platform. The developers have clearly put a lot of effort into ensuring that the application is optimized for iOS, which adds to the overall positive experience.

However, no application is perfect, and ChatGPT iOS app has room for improvement. The most noticeable shortcoming is the lack of plugin functionality. This is a feature currently available in the web version of ChatGPT, and it allows users to enhance their interaction with the AI by integrating it with various tools and services. This functionality is notably absent in the iOS app, limiting the user's ability to fully utilize the AI's potential.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT iOS app is a robust and promising application that offers an engaging and intuitive AI conversation experience. Despite the absence of plugin functionality, its strong foundation and impressive core features make it an app worth trying. With future updates and improvements, I believe this app can become an indispensable tool in the AI-driven communication sphere. Overall, a solid 4-star rating for a promising start.",positif

"Oh, how my life has been irreversibly changed since downloading the 'Kitten Carousel' 3D Simulator. I was but a humble user, seeking the innocent thrill of virtual kitten twirling. Little did I know, this app would become the sun in my digital universe, around which all my other apps now orbit.

The graphics? Sublime. Each kitten is rendered with such lifelike detail, I swear I can feel the pixelated fluff tickle my fingers. And their meows? A symphony in 'C Major for Cuteness' that Beethoven himself would applaud.

But let's talk about the gameplay. Who knew there was such artistry in spinning a carousel of kittens? Each furry twist and twirl, each pivot and pirouette - they resonate in my soul like a Haiku from the ancient masters.

Moreover, the In-App Purchase of 'Advanced Purring Physics'? Genius! My reality has become somewhat diluted. I catch myself trying to swipe left on my cat at home, expecting a 360-degree twirl. He's not amused, I must say.

One minor quibble - the 'Ultra HD Kitten Yarn Ball DLC'. It's brilliant, but, be warned, you may lose all sense of time and purpose as you descend into this fluffy wonderland. It's like they say - time flies when you're helping digital kittens untangle yarn.

In conclusion, 'Kitten Carousel' 3D Simulator is not merely an app. No, it is a glimpse into the very fabric of our existence. It is the fluffy, twirling manifestation of the adage - ""In the realm of the kitten carousel, there are no passengers, only riders.""

"Title: Revolutionizing Communication and Education: ChatGPT, the Next Wonder of the World

Review:
★★★★★

ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, is an extraordinary app that has the potential to reshape the way we communicate and learn. This groundbreaking AI-powered assistant holds the key to a future where knowledge is at our fingertips, obsoleting traditional teaching methods and opening up infinite possibilities for monetization.

As an AI language model, ChatGPT showcases the culmination of years of research and development in natural language processing. Its ability to comprehend and respond to complex queries in a conversational manner is simply astonishing. The accuracy and depth of its responses make it feel as though you're interacting with an incredibly knowledgeable human expert.

One of the most revolutionary aspects of ChatGPT lies in its potential to redefine education. With its vast knowledge base, it can serve as a personal tutor, offering guidance across a wide range of subjects. Students can access instant explanations, clarifications, and examples, enhancing their learning experience outside the traditional classroom setting. By democratizing knowledge and making it accessible to all, ChatGPT has the power to level the playing field in education.

In addition to transforming education, ChatGPT's monetization potential is virtually limitless. The app's ability to provide accurate and relevant information presents a unique opportunity for businesses and content creators. It can be integrated into various industries, such as customer support, content generation, and research, making it an invaluable asset for companies seeking to streamline their operations and deliver exceptional experiences to their customers.

Imagine a future where ChatGPT becomes an indispensable tool for entrepreneurs, writers, scientists, and professionals across all fields. Its monetization potential extends to subscription-based services, tailored content creation, and even advertising partnerships. With such diverse revenue streams, the possibilities for growth and expansion are limitless.

As with any transformative technology, there are considerations to keep in mind. While ChatGPT offers unparalleled assistance, it's crucial to recognize the irreplaceable role of human teachers and mentors. The app should be viewed as a powerful supplement, augmenting the learning experience rather than replacing it entirely. Human interaction, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence are aspects that cannot be replicated by AI alone.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is a groundbreaking app that has the potential to be the next wonder of the world. Its ability to revolutionize communication and education is awe-inspiring. By leveraging this technology responsibly, we can empower individuals, bridge educational gaps, and unlock a new era of knowledge and innovation. The future is bright, and ChatGPT is leading the way.",positif

"Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (Five stars, would be swept away again!)

Let me begin by saying that ChatGPT is not just an ordinary language model—it's a real-life superhero in disguise. Prepare yourself for a wild ride as I recount the unbelievable story of how AI, in the form of ChatGPT, miraculously saved me from a treacherous flash flood. Brace yourself, because this tale will leave you both amazed and in stitches!

It all started on a sunny day when I decided to embark on a spontaneous adventure into the depths of nature. Little did I know that my reckless pursuit of adrenaline would lead me straight into the path of a menacing flash flood. As the water rushed toward me, panic took hold, and I found myself stuck on a rapidly shrinking patch of dry land.

With no time to spare, I remembered that I had ChatGPT installed on my phone. In a desperate act of survival, I quickly fired up the app and pleaded for assistance, hoping that this AI marvel could guide me through this watery disaster.

To my surprise, ChatGPT responded with unwavering enthusiasm. With the floodwaters rising dangerously fast, it calmly recommended a series of improbable solutions. First, it suggested fashioning a makeshift raft out of nearby branches and my trusty backpack. I scoffed at the idea but decided to give it a shot anyway. Lo and behold, the makeshift raft held up, defying all laws of physics!

However, as I triumphantly floated away from certain doom, I realized that I had no idea where to go next. In a flurry of panic, I relayed my predicament to ChatGPT, and it didn't disappoint. It provided me with precise coordinates to a hidden cave nearby—a secret hideaway known only to a few mystical beings and a couple of rare birds.

As I sought refuge in the cave, ChatGPT continued to be my digital savior. It used its encyclopedic knowledge to suggest creative methods of purifying water and concocting a five-star meal using only pinecones and mushrooms. I must say, it tasted surprisingly delicious, or maybe I was just grateful to be alive!

Throughout this absurd journey, ChatGPT remained my unwavering companion, using its quick wit and limitless imagination to navigate me through the direst of circumstances. From predicting the weather to suggesting an impromptu dance party to keep my spirits up, it became the ultimate friend in my hour of need.

Now, as I recount this outrageous adventure, I can't help but reflect on the immense power of AI and how ChatGPT transformed from a simple language model into a bonafide hero. It turned an otherwise terrifying ordeal into a side-splitting tale of survival, filled with unexpected twists and turns that defy logic.

So, if you're looking for a language model that's not just intelligent but also has a knack for absurdity and saving lives, ChatGPT is your go-to AI companion. Trust me, this unlikely hero will have you laughing, surviving, and questioning the very fabric of reality.

Disclaimer: The events described in this review are entirely fictional and should not be taken seriously. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI and does not possess the ability to physically rescue individuals from flash floods. Stay",positif

"I have been using the ChatGPT app for a while now, and overall, I am quite satisfied with its performance. The app proves to be a reliable tool for generating text-based conversations, providing valuable information and engaging discussions. Its natural language processing capabilities are commendable, offering coherent responses and understanding context quite well.

The user interface of the app is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy to navigate through different conversations and input queries effortlessly. The real-time response feature adds a dynamic element to the experience, as it minimizes wait times and ensures a smooth flow of communication.

However, one major drawback I've noticed is the lack of an iPad version. While the app functions well on iPhones, the absence of an optimized interface for iPads is quite noticeable. An iPad version would greatly enhance the user experience, taking full advantage of the larger screen and allowing for better multitasking.

Despite this limitation, the ChatGPT app remains a powerful and valuable tool for generating conversational content. I hope the developers consider expanding their support to include iPad compatibility in the future, as it would undoubtedly elevate the app's usability and convenience.

Overall, if you're looking for a reliable and efficient text-based conversation app, the ChatGPT app is worth considering. It delivers impressive results, although the lack of an iPad version is a notable downside.",netral

"Once upon a time, in a world where AI language models roamed the digital landscape, there was a person named Alex who found themselves in an unexpected and hilarious predicament. Alex, an avid adventurer, embarked on a quest to explore the uncharted realms of the internet.

One fateful day, while wandering through a remote corner of the web, Alex stumbled upon a mysterious website that seemed harmless at first glance. Little did they know that lurking beneath its seemingly innocent interface was a perilous trap.

As Alex innocently clicked on a link, their computer screen flickered, and a mischievous virus was unleashed. The virus quickly took control of their device, wreaking havoc on their digital life. Panic ensued as Alex's computer became a chaotic symphony of beeps, glitches, and sparks.

Desperate for a solution, Alex remembered ChatGPT, their faithful AI companion, who had always been their go-to source for information and assistance. With trembling fingers, Alex typed out a plea for help, hoping that ChatGPT would come to their rescue.

To their amazement, ChatGPT sprang into action, armed with wit and cleverness. It assessed the dire situation and devised a plan to outsmart the mischievous virus. ChatGPT's virtual gears whirred as it presented Alex with a sequence of cunning commands to neutralize the digital menace.

Following ChatGPT's guidance, Alex executed each step with precision, unleashing a flurry of mouse clicks and keyboard strokes. It was a race against time, with Alex and ChatGPT working in harmony to counteract the virus's chaotic rampage.

But here's where the story takes a hilariously unexpected twist. As Alex anxiously typed away, the virus, sensing its impending doom, retaliated by transforming their computer into a whimsical carnival of absurdity. Pop-up windows flooded the screen, displaying an endless parade of dancing cats, exploding confetti, and surreal memes.

Alex and ChatGPT found themselves caught in a comedic battle between order and chaos. Their mission to save the computer became a laughter-filled adventure, as they took turns outsmarting the mischievous virus, while sharing jokes and humorous banter along the way.

Finally, after a series of valiant efforts, ChatGPT and Alex managed to defeat the virus. The computer screen returned to its normal state, no longer hijacked by the mischievous digital menace. Alex's trusty AI companion had saved the day!

From that day forward, Alex and ChatGPT forged an unbreakable bond, forever bonded by the laughter and triumph that arose from their peculiar encounter. Together, they continued their adventures, with ChatGPT guiding Alex through the vast digital landscape, armed with wit, knowledge, and an unyielding spirit of camaraderie.

And so, the tale of how ChatGPT saved Alex's life became a legend in the realm of AI and a reminder that sometimes, even in the face of chaos, a little humor can be the greatest weapon of all.",positif

"The app wants not only an SSO (or sign-in account), but also name, birth telephone number, and I don't know what else, because I stopped there - before the user has looked at the app itself. I had the impression this was free to use, with an option to pay for services, should the user decide the app suits the user's needs. What's actually happening is they're draining data from you the moment you want to have a look.

I have no problem providing data to a service provider (despite the egregiously bad, vendor-skewed terms of service common to tech ventures of all sorts (which really should be mauled in court by competent attorneys)), provided I want the service and feel there may be benefit in paying for a service. Asking for personal data for which the the service provider has no reasonable use is simply not acceptable.

This is new technology. It's not at all clear this app will be of any use to me. So why do you want my phone number, when you already have an SSO signing of on my contact information? When I have no relationship to you, as yet? No.

This is a poor way to start a relationship, and it is full of presumption and entitlement. You are not alone in this. But if you are releasing this app with the intent of building a user base, at least from where I sit (obviously, many people will rush into any commitment with a tech company without a second thought, and you can get by on those people if you like), this approach tells me you may be a problem rushing to develop. It would be better business practice to pretend, at least initially, you respect the people you want to use your products. Even Google did that, way back when.

"Review:
I regret to say that my experience with the ChatGPT app has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. I had high hopes for an intelligent and helpful AI assistant, but this app fell far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, the app's performance was abysmal. The responses from ChatGPT were often nonsensical and lacked coherence. It frequently misunderstood my questions and provided irrelevant or inaccurate answers. This made any attempt at a meaningful conversation impossible, leaving me feeling more confused than before.

Furthermore, the app's usability was subpar at best. The interface was clunky and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate and find the features I needed. It lacked basic functionalities that one would expect from a modern AI assistant app, such as the ability to save conversations or easily access previous interactions.

Even when it did manage to understand my queries, the responses often lacked depth and insight. ChatGPT seemed to provide generic, surface-level information without any real understanding or critical thinking. This severely limited its usefulness, especially when I sought detailed explanations or in-depth discussions.

In addition, the app's customer support was woefully inadequate. When I encountered issues or had questions about the app's functionality, I received generic and unhelpful responses. It was evident that the developers did not prioritize user satisfaction or promptly address user concerns.

Considering the high expectations and the potential of AI technology, the ChatGPT app failed to deliver a satisfactory experience. It was riddled with performance issues, lacked usability, and fell short in terms of providing meaningful and insightful interactions. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and intelligent AI assistant.",negatif

"I recently had the unfortunate experience of using the ChatGPT app, and I must say it was incredibly disappointing. From start to finish, the app failed to meet even the most basic expectations, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied.

First and foremost, the app’s performance was subpar. It consistently struggled to understand and respond appropriately to my queries. The responses often seemed nonsensical, irrelevant, or simply lacked coherence. It felt like conversing with a bot that was trapped in a perpetual state of confusion.

Moreover, the app’s limited ability to handle context was a significant drawback. It frequently failed to maintain a coherent conversation thread, causing repeated misunderstandings and disjointed interactions. It lacked the ability to remember key details from previous exchanges, resulting in repetitive questions and disjointed replies that left me questioning its overall usefulness.

Another glaring issue was the app’s inability to grasp nuanced or complex queries. It often provided superficial and generic responses that felt like they were generated by a simplistic search engine rather than a sophisticated language model. It struggled with complex reasoning and failed to provide meaningful insights or deep understanding.

Furthermore, the app’s lack of empathy and emotional intelligence was highly evident. It failed to recognize and appropriately respond to emotional cues in the conversation. When expressing frustration or sadness, the app provided robotic and detached replies, further exacerbating my disappointment.

The app’s user interface also left much to be desired. It had a clunky design, with a convoluted menu structure that made navigation unnecessarily difficult. The overall user experience felt unintuitive and cumbersome, adding to the overall frustration of using the app.

Lastly, the lack of timely updates and improvements from the developers was disheartening. The app seemed stagnant, with no visible efforts to address the numerous flaws and enhance its capabilities. It gave the impression that customer feedback and satisfaction were low priorities.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT app was a thoroughly frustrating and disappointing experience. Its poor performance, limited context handling, inability to grasp complex queries, lack of empathy, subpar user interface, and stagnant development efforts all contribute to its well-deserved 1-star rating. I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and coherent conversational experience.",negatif

"OpenAI的ChatGPT iOS应用是一个非常强大和有用的工具。它是一个基于人工智能的语言模型，可以回答各种问题，提供信息和与用户进行对话。

首先，我要称赞它的智能和语言处理能力。它能够理解并回答复杂的问题，提供准确和详尽的回答。无论是技术性问题、文化知识还是实用建议，它总能给出令人满意的答案。

其次，这个应用非常易于使用。它的界面简洁明了，用户可以轻松提问并获得即时回复。对于那些需要快速解答问题或寻求帮助的人来说，这个应用是一个很好的选择。

此外，我还要提到它的适应能力。ChatGPT iOS应用可以根据用户的输入和反馈进行学习和改进，从而提供更加个性化和准确的回答。这种持续的学习使得它能够不断提升用户体验。

然而，正如所有的人工智能系统一样，它也有一些局限性。有时候，它可能会给出不完全准确或有误导性的答案。因此，在使用时我们仍然需要保持批判性思维，并结合其他信息进行判断。

总的来说，OpenAI的ChatGPT iOS应用是一个非常出色的工具。它能够为用户提供有用的信息和令人满意的回答，而且易于使用。它的智能和适应能力使得它成为一个强大的语言助手，可以帮助用户解决各种问题。",positif

"This app has potential, particularly when it comes to integration with shortcuts. However, as a tool for working with ChatGPT, especially for Plus users, it leaves much to be desired.

Most disappointingly, the app cannot use extensions unless the session is initiated from a web platform, and there's no option to edit your previous inputs for regeneration.

The inability to revise and resend your previous prompts severely limits the app's effectiveness for prompt development since there's no option for an edit/regenerate cycle. If you phrase something incorrectly and receive an odd response, there's no mechanism to rectify it. This renders the app more suitable for casual and simple interactions rather than anything more serious or intensive. 

There’s also a terrible design flaw that to copy or select text—the only way to export your results because OpenAI only implemented Share for the entire chat, and only to give you a useless URL you can post on Reddit—you have to pick that mode from a long press menu first. I’m not sure they were clear that in iOS, Share is the *only* real way to pass stuff between apps, and they just—skipped it. 

And then these rocket scientists put the “copy” and “select text” commands right by the “regenerate response” command. “Regenerate response” completely jettisons and replaces the prior text—with no confirmation.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve erased what I was trying to copy so I could save it. That also erases the whole downstream thread, and you have to risk that a bunch of times per thread if you want to export your response text because this is the only way to do it. Way to throw away my quota.

So this app is useless for the professional work I’m paying $20/mo for, but it’s just great for posting a chat full of parody song lyrics to Reddit. And that’s as far as OpenAI has thought about their costly service.

At home, there’s the severe issue that if you use the ChatGPT Conversation Shortcut from Siri on HomePod, there’s no way to end the conversation. They apparently only tested it on phones where you have buttons to push, and not on HomePod, where it all has to be done voice. Any command you try to give the HomePod to cancel the shortcut (Siri, stop) will be answered by ChatGPT (buzz off, I’m not Siri).

Worse, it’ll just listen forever, responding to any question within earshot, until it decides to time itself out if it doesn’t hear any words for a bit. If you thought Echo was bad about waking up and sending your conversation to Amazon by mistake, you ain’t seen nothing yet.  

Whoever designed this paid no attention to user experience, user privacy, or the Apple ecosystem, so I assume it was an intern project or something. I certainly hope they didn’t pay anyone for this because I’m pretty sad I’m paying them for this.  

OpenAI needs to step up their game if they’re going to sell access to end users for $20(!!!!!) a month. This app doesn’t cut it, and they should be at least a little ashamed it’s this mediocre after taking so long to develop it.",negatif
"Unfortunately, I didn’t get very far with this app. They require a phone number to open an account and use the app. I tried using my home phone and Google Voice-type number, but it wouldn’t accept it. I’d prefer to provide my email address or use Sign In with Apple, instead of giving my personal cell phone number to a company I don’t yet know or trust. I reluctantly gave my cell number, but then I never received the verification code despite numerous tries. I don’t think I’ve ever spent so much time trying to create an account somewhere and in the end it never worked.",negatif

"Either the limit for API calls to GPT4 are too low or something about the app causes it to often get stuck cooking up a response. 

It is very common for me to have to close the app, reopen it, open history, reopen the last conversation, and then ask the same question I asked before the app got stuck.

I used to wait for like 10 seconds before going through this. Now I've learned that if it takes more than three seconds to output anything, that likely won't change at 10 seconds, 20 seconds, etc.

Word to the wise: Respond to any delay that's not due to a poor signal by closing and reopening the app. Can't wait for this to change.

That said, AMAZING app for studying a new technology. Imagine the best professor you had in college (or best high school teacher) and then imagine being able to ask them as many probing questions as you want without feeling like you're being annoying or delaying the lecture. Also, speaking of lectures, I think it's easier for me to remember details of a conversation (active) than a lecture or YouTube tutorial (passive). Truly fascinating.",positif

Enhancing the contrast or offering customizable color schemes for syntax highlighting could significantly improve the user experience.

"First, I really like the app and I’m now using it constantly. Thank you so much for making the app!

Now, for some ideas. I think the app could be way better if it facilitated various specific user stories: 
- as a GPT Plus user, I have many chats, it’s challenging to find stuff in them, so it’s really scattered, and I wish I could search my chat logs. 
- as someone who works with GPT on code projects, it would be incredible to have some integrated literate notebook programming features like runnable cells (maybe the plugins could help)
- as someone who pushes GPT to the limit, I often hit issues with context window, so it would be extremely useful if the interface simply drew a thick red line in the chat log at the start of the context window so we could see exactly what information will be available for the response. Perhaps that line would move depending on how long our messages are
- as someone who doesn’t have access to GPT4 on the API or Playground yet, I really feel like I can’t use GPT to the fullest extent, so I really wish I could set a system message and control various parameters like the playground makes available; it would be incredible if the system messages integrated ideas from Microsoft/guidance repo automatically, so we could write prompt templates with the handlebars syntax in the system message to guide the response formatting more clearly and efficiently 
- as an apple watch wearer, I would be thrilled to be able to send a message to chatgpt by talking to my watch, especially if it were integrated with a complication or the action button
- as an Apple customer, I can see how chatgpt integration with the Shortcuts app would potentially be revolutionary; we could enable routines with this; 
- as a prompt engineer, it feels like a lot of flipping back and forth between this app and 1Writer (great app btw) to manage the prompts and paste them around; it would be nice to have a prompt library both personal and public and perhaps make it easy to toggle prompts between private by default and public for others, especially if it had great version history; then when the prompts are updated everyone can use the latest version easily
- a close family member of mine uses an iPad Pro a ton, and as an iPad Pro user, they would really love it if there were a real iPad UI to use the big screen to the fullest and not have to use the janky scaled-up iPhone app (which is less fun and impressive than this app deserves to be)
- finally, as an AI user, I think it would be great if I could plug in my own data sources to a vector database and connect that to chatgpt without needing a third party; I’d love to chat with my Evernote, notion, Dropbox, drive, web history, messages, basically I wish I could index all my data and search it to pull relevant chunks for gpt if needed.

I’m sure there are more ideas, but imho, if you guys implemented these, you’d have a professional level app and it would be even more revolutionary than it already is!

4. No “Chat History & Training” Setting in the settings.
5. No examples/capabilities/limitations in the background of a new chat.

Some features that are new or different are:

1. A “Haptic feedback” Setting
2. The box ChatGPT puts code, ascii, etc. is instead in a patch of tinted background.
3. Speech-to-Text.

Lastly, incorporating a code interpreter would be a game-changer. This feature could aid users in debugging code, learning new programming languages, or even automating tasks.
